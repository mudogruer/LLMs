A blue new born presents with cyanosis. The X–ray chest reveal oligaemic lung field and normal sized heart. Most likely diagnosis is –,"The findings in this newborn are
Cyanosis at birth
Oligaemic lung .fields
Normal sized heart
Lets see each option one by one
Ebstein anomaly - It can be easily ruled out as there is marked cardiomegaly in it.
Transposition of great vessels- There is cardiomegaly and plethoric lung fields see in it. So ruled out.
Now the real confusion - between PA and TOF.
TOF - in TOF there is oligaemic lung fields and normal sized heart but usually cyanosis is not present at birth.

A mother is Hbs Ag positive and anti Hbe Ag positive. Risk of transmission of Hep. B in child is:,"Before answering these questions lets first discuss hepatitis in brief.
Maternal infection: The acute infection is manifested by flu like illness as malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon.
Clinical course (HBV): Nearly 90–95% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Diagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107–1011).
Screening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for ‘high risk’ groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).
Hepatitis C (HCV):
It is recognized as the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide and is the leading cause of transfusion associated hepatitis. Transmission is mainly blood borne and to a lesser extent by faecal-oral route. It is responsible for chronic active hepatitis and hepatic failure.
Perinatal transmission (10–40%) is high when coinfected with HIV and HBV.
Detection is by antibody to HCV by EIA, which develops usually late in the infection.
Confirmation is done by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-3).
Chronic carrier state is present. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.
Hepatitis D (HDV):
It is seen in patients infected with HBV either as a co-infection or super infection. Perinatal transmission is known.
Hepatitis E (HEV): Hepatitis E is the most important cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis in developing countries like India. Chronic carrier state is present. Perinatal transmission is uncommon.

Continued treatment with maintenance doses may be required for 1-2 weeks. Neostigmine and physostigmine worsens the signs and symptoms as these also act by inhibiting choline esterase.

Key Points 
HBsAg:

The antigen appears in blood during incubation period and is detectable in most patients during the prodrome and acute phase of the disease.
Persistent presence of HBsAg in blood for at least 6 months indicates the carrier state and also indicates the risk of chronic hepatitis and hepatic carcinoma. It is not detectable in the serum during convalescent stage. The presence of HBsAg alone does not necessarily indicate the replication of complete virion, and the patients may not have symptoms of liver damage.

"A patient went into shock immediately after normal delivery, likely cause:","Friends this is one of those questions where we can derive the answer by excluding other options as very little information has been provided to us.
Sudden post partum collapse – may be seen in all the four cases viz – amniotic fluid embolism, PPH, uterine inversion and eclampsia.
But in case of PPH antecedent H/O excessive blood loss, in eclampsia – H/O antecedent convulsions and in amniotic fluid embolism – H/O abrupt onset of respiratory distress before collapse should be present, which is not given in the question so these options are being excluded.
The clinical picture of acute inversion occurring in the third stage of labour is characterised by shock and haemorrhage, the shock being out of proportion to the bleeding.
Since this a problem which occurs due to mismanaged third stage of labour, patient doesnot have any complain in the antenatal period or during labour.

"Which of the following type of failure may occur, if the coefficient of thermal expansion of ceramic is much lower than that of metal?","A thermal contraction mismatch that results from a higher coeﬃcient of contraction of porcelain (αP is greater than αM) will introduce residual tangential and hoop tensile stresses. The additive eﬀect of tangential tensile stress induced in the porcelain by the intraoral force can exceed the tensile strength of the porcelain and causes crack propagation in the porcelain veneer. When the contraction coeﬃcient of the porcelain is much lower than that of the metal (αP much lower than αM), porcelain cracking or metal-ceramic bond failure can occur near the metal-porcelain interface. This incompatibility failure is likely caused by the development of radial tensile stresses that exceed the tensile strength of porcelain.
Contraction coeﬃcient of the porcelain - αP  
Contraction coeﬃcient of the metal - αM

Sugar restricted to diet was beneficial in presence of unfavorable hygiene was from which study?,"HOPEWOOD HOUSE STUDY 
(Sullivan and Harris- 1958, Harris- 1963 ) 
The dental status Of children between 7 to 14 years of age residing at Hopewood House, Bowral New South Wales, was studied longitudinally for 10 years. Almost all these children had lived from early infancy at Hopewood House. 
All lived on a strictly natural diet, that, with the exception of on occasional serving of egg yolk, was entirely vegetable in nature and largely raw. The absence of meat and restriction of refined carbohydrate were the principal features of the Hopewood House diet. 
The meals were supplemented by vitamin concentrates and an occasional serving of nuts and a sweetening agent such as honey. The fluoride content of water and food was insignificant and no tea was consumed. 
TURKU SUGAR STUDY 
(Scheinin and Makinen in 975) 
The study was carried outin Turku, Finland. 
Aim Of the study 
To compare the cariogenicity of sucrose, fructose and Xylitol. 
Basis of the study 
XylitoI is a sweet substance not metabolized by plaque micro organisms.
Key Concept:
In Hopewood house study : the children's oral hygiene was poor, calculus is uncommon,  but  gingivitis  was  prevalent  in 75%  of  children. This work  showed  that,  in institutionalized  children  at  least,  dental caries  can  be  reduced  by  a  spartan  diet, without the beneficial effects of fluoride  and in the presence of unfavorable oral hygiene.

"In alpha-thalassemia trait,electrophoresis shows:March 2005","Ans. B: Normal HbF and normal HbA2Alpha (0) thalassemia -Individuals with this disorder are not able to produce any functional alpha-globin and thus are unable to make any functional hemoglobin A, F, or A2. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis, also known as hemoglobin Ba, a condition that is incompatible with extra uterine life.Alpha (+) thalassemia - genetic mutations that result in decreased production of alpha-globin usually due to the functional deletion of 1 of the 4 alpha globin genes. Based on the number of inherited alpha genes, it is subclassified into 3 general forms:Thalassemia (-u/ a a) is characterized by inheritance of 3 normal a-genes. These patients are referred to clinically as silent carrier of alpha thalassemia. Other names for this condition are alpha thalassemia minima, alpha thalassemia-2 trait, and heterozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia minor. The affected individuals exhibit no abnormality clinically and may be hematologically normal or have mild reductions in red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of 2 normal alpha genes due to either heterozygosity for alpha (0) thalassemia (u a/ --) or homozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia (-u/-a) results in the development of alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia-1 trait. The affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia and reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of one normal alpha gene (-a/ --) results in abundant formation of hemoglobin H.

Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.

Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.

–– Alport syndrome is manifest by hematuria with progression to chronic renal failure, accompanied by nerve deafness and various eye disorders, including lens dislocation, posterior cataracts, and corneal dystrophy.
–– In about 85% cases, it is inherited as an X-linked trait. So, males express the full syndrome, and females are carriers in whom manifestations of disease are typically limited to hematuria.

Which of the following is used for etching porcelain?,"Chemical preparation of glazed ceramic may be done with 9.6% hydrofluoric acid (HFA) or acidulated phosphate fluoride and then treated with silane coupling agent to increase the bond strength.
Zachrisson recommends the following techniques for bonding to porcelain surfaces:

Isolation is very critical in this technique, not just to prevent contamination with saliva and water, but also to prevent soft tissues contact with HFA.

"A screening test is used in same way in two similar populations, but the proportion of false positive results among those who test positive in population A is lower than among those who test positive in population B. What is the likely explanation for this finding?","Total population having the disease : ‘a + c’ (TP + FN)
Total population not having the disease : ‘b + d’ (FP + TN)
Total population: a + b + c + d = TP + FP + FN + TN

PPV depends on sensitivity, specificity and prevalence of disease in the population.
Now in this question, a screening test is used in same way in two similar populations; thereby the screening test will have similar sensitivity and specificity in both populations.
PPV = a/ (a + (b) X 100, thus b (False Positive rate) is inversely proportional to PPV; and PPV is directly proportional to Prevalence of disease in a population.
So, False Positive rate (FP rate) is inversely proportional to the prevalence of disease in the population.
Therefore, if the same screening test is having lower FP rate in population A (as compared to a similar population B), then this could be explained by higher prevalence of disease in population A

Strain is defined as:,"Strain—Change in dimension per unit initial dimension. For tensile and compressive strain, a change in length is measured relative to the initial reference length.
Strain, or the change in length per unit length, is the relative deformation of an object subjected to a stress. Strain may be either elastic, plastic, elastic and plastic, or viscoelastic. Elastic strain is reversible. The object fully recovers its original shape when the force is removed.

Which cement is irritating to the pulp?,"The phosphoric acid in the liquid makes the mixture quite acidic and therefore cytotoxic, when a prosthesis is luted with this cement on a prepared tooth. As setting occurs, the acidity is partially neutralized, but the cement remains acidic after 24 hours, with the pH rising from about 3 to about 6. For thin layers of dentin, a cavity liner (i.e.,Ca2) is recommended to prevent an adverse pulpal response from the pressure of luting, which forces acid into the pulp tissue. Younger patients are especially susceptible, because they have a more open dentin tubule area, whereas older patients with sclerotic dentin will have a more tortuous path that restricts the penetration of acid toward the pulp.
Key concept​​ :
pH of the cement
The acidity is high at the time of insertion due to phosphoric acid. At the time of cementation, the pH is 2 (approx.). As time passes, the acidity reduces. By the end of 24 hours, the pH is 5.5, which is still in the acidic range (neutral value is 7).

a. Age of onset is around 5 months.

Development may proceed normally until 1 yr of age, when regression of language and motor milestones become apparent.

a. Acquired microcephaly (Decleration of head growth due to significantly reduced brain weight).
* Most children develop peculiar sighing respirations with intermittent periods of apnea that may be associated with cyanosis --> Breath holding spells.

The hallmark of Rett syndrome is repetitive hand wringing movements and a loss ofpurposeful and spontaneous use of the hands.
Autistic behavior is a typical finding in all patients.
Generalized tonic-clonic convulsions occur in the majority.
Feeding disorder and poor weight gain are common.
Death occurs in adolescence or in the 3rd decade.

Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.
The problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:

(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body
Entrace and exit of the ventricle
Mitral and aortic valves

This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.
In patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.
The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic

arteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two
of these connections:
(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)
Ductus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)

Both of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.
In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.
Babies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.
Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).

Symptoms

At first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:


Bluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color
Cold hands and feed (extremities)


Lethargy


Poor pulse
Poor suckling and feeding
Pounding heart
Rapid breathing
Shortness of breath.
Since the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.
Signs of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.

Ventricular septal defect

These patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.
They usually present with congestive cardiac failure.

Ebstein's anomaly 

Ebstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.
These patients usually present in teenage/adolescent years.
They may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.

Aorticopulmonary window defect

An Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.
In these cases minimal cyanosis is present and they may present with heart failure in infancy.",2,VSD large,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,Ebstein anomaly,AP window defect,Pediatrics,,2e78ce60-b4af-41c4-b2bd-595a6e728c1d,single,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,0.9999999403953552,0.6478074789047241,0.9999999403953552,0.6657199859619141,0.6967166662216187,2

Staphylococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve is a common complication of intravenous drug use. Many acquired and congenital cardiac lesions are vulnerable, particularly areas of endocardial damage caused by a high-pressure jet of blood, such as ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, many of which are haemodynamically insigniﬁcant.

Apgars 4 and 5 at 1 and 5 minutes. History of one month female sibling died before. What is the diagnosis ?","""Respiratory distress in an infant along with a positive family history of similarly affected newborn infants strongly suggests, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis"".
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disorder characterized by the intraalveolar accumulation of pulmonary surfactant.
Two clinically distinct forms of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis are seen -


Fatal form                                -->          Presenting shortly after birth (congenital PAP)

u Gradually progressive form -->           Presenting in older infants and children
Pathology

Although the mechanisms that lead to alveolar proteinosis are undefined, histological findings suggests that they result in a disruption of pulmonary surfactant metabolism.
The main surface tension lowering agent in surfactant is phospholipids le. primary dipalmitol phosphatidyl choline.
However DPCC needs surfactant protein (in endogenous and natural surfactants) for efficient dispersion which enables the formation of a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.
There are two surfactant proteins present in the body i.e., protein A and protein B.
In pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, there is absence of protein B.
In the absence of protein B, the rapid spread and absorption of the phospholipid (DPCC) does not take place so they cannot form a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.
This in turn leads to failure of expansion of alveoli leading to poor cardiorespiratory adaptation at birth.

Clinical manifestation -

This disorder is immediately apparent in the newborn period and rapidly leads to respiratory failure.
Congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from more common disorders of the newborn that lead to respiratory failure including pneumonia, generalized bacterial infection, respiratory distress syndrome and total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction.

Diagnosis

Histopathological examination of lung biopsy specimen is the gold standard for diagnosis.
On histopathological examination distal air spaces are filled with a granular, eosinophillic material that stains

positively with periodic - acid schiff reagent and is diastase resistant.
Treatment

Untreated, alveolar proteinosis in newborns is rapidly fatal and no successful medical therapy has been developed.
Repeated bronchoalveolar lavage is a temporizing measure.
Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option but its use is limited by concerns about disease recurrence.",3,TAPVC,Meconium aspiration,Neonatal pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,Diffuse herpes simplex infection,Pediatrics,,f1cbc766-a7ea-44ec-ba8b-997ffc3a028a,single,Neonatal pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,Neonatal pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,0.9999999403953552,0.6300538182258606,0.6752675771713257,0.9999999403953552,0.7392385005950928,3

Hardness of stone surface is affected by?,"Colloidal systems such as agar and alginate retard the setting of gypsum products. If these materials are in contact with CaSO4·½H2O during setting, a soft, easily abraded surface is obtained. Accelerators such as potassium sulfate are added to improve the surface quality of the set CaSO4·2H2O against agar or alginate.
These colloids do not retard the setting by altering the solubility ratio of the hemihydrate and dihydrate forms, but rather by being adsorbed on the hemihydrate and dihydrate nucleation sites, thus interfering in the hydration reaction. The adsorption of these materials on the nucleating sites retards the setting reaction more effectively than adsorption on the calcium sulfate hemihydrate.

A transient form of DI occurs during pregnancy due to:

– Excessive placental production of vasopressinase
– Decreased hepatic clearance due to abnormal liver function there in case of:

Preeclampsia
Fatty liver
Hepatitis.


Approximately 60% of women with previously known DI worsen, 20% improve and 20% do not change during pregnancy.
Worsening is attributed to excessive placental vasopressinase production.
Some females with DI who develop placental insufficiency show DI improvement, which is attributed to decreased vasopressinase production by the damaged placenta.

"The principal reason for placing an aluminium filter in
the primary beam of radiation is to:","Although an x-ray beam consists of a continuous spectrum of x-ray photon energies, only photons with sufficient energy to penetrate through anatomic structures and reach the image receptor (digital or film) are useful for diagnostic radiology. Low-energy photons that cannot reach the receptor contribute to patient risk but do no offer any benefit. Consequently, it is desirable to remove these low-energy photons from the beam. This removal can be accomplished in part by placing a metallic disk (filter) in the beam path. 
A filter preferentially removes low-energy photons from the beam, while allowing high energy photons that are able to contribute to making an image to pass through.

Vesicoureteric reflux is more common in –,"Clinical manifestations of VUR 

In primary reflux the average age ofpresentation is 2-3 years.
Reflux is more common in females and it is usually detected earlier in females so we can say that reflux is present from birth but it is usually detected at 2-3 years of age but in feinales the age of detection is earlier.

Features are -

In primary reflux the patient usually presents with symptoms of pyelonephritis or cystitis.
In secondary reflux manifestation of primary diseases are usually the presenting symptoms
Reflux is the most common cause of pyelonephritis. It is seen in 30-50% of patients with pyelonephritis.
It is present in over 75% of patients with radiological evidence of chronic pyelonephritis Diagnosis of Vesicoureteric reflux -
The most useful process for conclusive diagnosis of reflux is micturating cystourethrogram.

The other useful technique for detecting vesicoureteric reflux is radionuclide imaging.

Macrocephaly is seen in which of the following syndromes ?,"LEUCO J ITS TROPHY

Leucodystrophy refers to progressive degeneration of the white matter of the brain clue to imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibre.
Myelin which lends its color to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of at least ten different chemicals.
The leucodystrophy are a group of disorders that are caused by genetic defects in hoW myelin produces or metabolizes these chemicals.
Each of the leucodystrophies in the result of a defect in the gene that controls one (and only one) of the chemicals. Specific leusodystrophies include -
Metachroinatic leucodystrophy          ❑ Adrenoleucodystrophy                                 

​❑ Canavan disease

Krabbe's disease                                                 ❑ Pelizaeus-Merzhacher disease                                                         ​ ❑ Alexander disease


Symptoms vary according to the specific type of leucodystrophy and may be difficult to recognize in the early stages of the disease.

Canavan's disease 

Autosomal recessive disorder
Caused due to deficiency of the enzyme N-Aspertoacylase.
This leads to accumulation of N-Acetyl aspartic acid in brain and urine.
It is characterized by the clinical traid of --> Hypotonia, Head lag, Macrocephaly 

​​Adrenoleucodvstrophy

X-linked recessive disorder
Caused due to deficiency of AcyI-C'oA synthetase.
Onset is about 5-10 years
Main symptoms are ataxia, spasticity, motor deficits, cortical blindness.
Marocephaly is not a key feature 
Metachromatic leucodystrophy 
Autosomal recessive disorder
Caused due to Arylsulfatase A deficiency
Onset is in the 2nd year.
Symptoms are into-ordination, especially gait disturbance, then general regression, optic atrophy, combined upper and lower motor neuron signs.
Marocephaly usually late.

The major effect of coicosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription. Coicosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of IQ-receptors.

NESTROFT test is a screening test for –,"NESTROFT ( Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test) is a screening test for detection of beta thalassemia trait.

Thalassemia screening

Widespead prevlence of thalessemia has led to a pressing demand for community, screening.
Various methods for screening of thalassemia trait are available which include peripheral smear examination, RBC indices, 1VIeintzer's fraction, discriminant functions, NESTROFT etc.
NESTROFT TEST is used in many centres in India for screening of thalassemia trait.
If mother is NESTROFT positive, the confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for mother and the father is subjected to screening by NESTROFT. If father is also NESTROFT positive, confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for father.
If both the parents have thalessemia trait, there is 1:4 chance of fetus having thalassemia major.
Therefore, prenatal diagnosis is done by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in first trimester.
If CVS confirms the fetus to be having thalasemia major, termination of pregnancy is indicated after counseling the parents.
If the fetus has thalassemia minor (trait) pregnancy is continued as such and baby will have normal lifespan.

Reverse (or negative) alveolar bone architecture is the result of a loss  of  interdental  bone,  without  a  concomitant  loss  of  radicular (buccal or lingual/palatal) bone, thereby reversing the normal (or positive)  architecture .  Negative  architecture  is  more common in the maxilla of patients with periodontitis.
Ledges
Ledges are plateau-like bone margins that are caused by the resorption of thickened bony plates .
Osseous Craters
Osseous craters are a specific type of two-wall defect; they present as concavities in the crest of the interdental bone that is confined within the facial and lingual walls. Craters have been found to make up about one-third (35.2%) of all defects and about two-thirds (62%) of all mandibular defects; they occur twice as often in posterior segments as in anterior segments.

Which characteristic of orthodontic wire describe energy storage capacity?,"Popularly, the term resilience is associated with springiness, but it means precisely the amount of energy absorbed within a unit volume of a structure when it is stressed to its proportional limit. 
The resilience of two or more materials can be compared by observing the areas under the elastic region of their stress-strain plots assuming that they are plotted on the same scale. The material with the larger elastic area has higher resilience.
Key Concept:
Resilience—The amount of elastic energy per unit volume that is sustained on loading and released upon unloading of a test specimen.

"The single most effective method of reducing patient
somatic exposure when taking radiograph is to use:","Intraoral dental X-ray film is available in two speed groups: D and E/F.
Clinically, film of speed group E/F is approximately twice as fast (sensitive) as film of group D and thus requires only half the exposure. Fast films are desirable from the standpoint of exposure reduction. Multiple studies have found that E/F-speed film is preferred, because it has the same useful density range, latitude, contrast, and image quality as D-speed films and can be used in routine intraoral radiographic examinations without sacrifice of diagnostic information. 
Current digital sensors offer equal or greater dose savings than E/F-speed film and comparable diagnostic utility.

The 2 most common symptoms are usually fever and flank pain. E. coli is the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis due to its unique ability to adhere to and colonize the urinary tract and kidneys.Histopathology will usually reveal necrosis or putrid abscess formation within the renal parenchyma. The renal tissues are infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages and plasma cells. However, architecture is not completely disorganized.The presence of white blood cells within or upon casts strongly suggests pyelonephritis, direct infection of the kidney.

"All are true about rheumatic fever, except –","Rheumatic fever

Rheumatic fever is an acute immunologically mediated multisystem inflammatory disease that occurs few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.
The disease is immune mediated, not a communicable disease.
	Epidemiology ofAcute Rheumatic fever.
The epidemiology of acute Rheumatic fever is identical to that of group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection.
As is the case of streptococcal sore throat, acute rheumatic fever most often occurs in children, the peak age related incidence is between 5-15 years.
Epidemiological risk factor for rheumatic fever, include lower standards of living especially crowding, the disease has been more common among socially and economically disadvantaged populations.

Pathogenesis of Rheumatic fever

It is strongly suspected that acute Rheumatic fever is a hypersensitivity reaction induced by group A streptococci but the exact pathogenesis remains uncertain despite many years of investigation.
Although the precise factor or factors that confer this property are unknown, highly rheumatogenic strains, share certain biological characteristic.
It is believed that antibodies directed against the M proteins of certain strains cross reacts with glycoprotein antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues. These strains are (1, 3, 5, 6, 18).
The M proteins molecules has a particular surface exposed antigenic domain against which Rheumatic fever patients mount a strong antibody response. These antibodies against the M proteins cross reacts with glycoproteins antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues because these glycoproteins share similar features with M antigenic domain.",3,Common in poor socioeconomic group,Develops after streptococcal pharyngitis,Communicable disease,Seen in 5–15 years of children,Pediatrics,,41fac382-483b-4573-99c4-555b80dff3bc,multi,Communicable disease,Option 3: Communicable disease,0.9126142263412476,0.6704341173171997,0.7134538292884827,0.9126142263412476,0.6549089550971985,3

Bonding agents have hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. The hydrophobic group binds which structure?,"Ideally, a dentin bonding agent should have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The hydrophilic end displaces the dentinal fluid to wet the surface. The hydrophobic end bonds to the composite resin.
Bonding: The forces or energies between atoms or molecules at an interface that hold two phases together.
Mechanism of bonding:
Dentin adhesive molecule has a bifunctional structure:
M-R-X
Where,
M is the double bond of methacrylate which copolymerizes with composite resin.
R is the spacer which makes the molecule large.

The graph shows the relative viscosities and working times of zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, and GICs as they set. 
A cool slab lengthens the working time for zinc carboxylate cement, although it causes the polyacrylic acid to thicken, which hinders mixing. 
Refrigerating the powder is useful, because it retards the reaction without raising the viscosity of the liquid.
Polycarboxylate cements are more viscous than a comparable mix of GIC; however, the polycarboxylate mix undergoes thinning at an increased shear rate.

Posterior pituitary insufficiency leads to:,"ADH SYNTHESIS IN SUPRAOPTIC AND PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEI OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS AND ADH RELEASE FROM THE POSTERIOR PITUITARY
Figure shows the neuroanatomy of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, where ADH is synthesized and released. The hypothalamus contains two types of magnocellular (large) neurons that synthesize ADH in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, about five sixths in the supraoptic nuclei and about one sixth in the paraventricular nuclei. Both of these nuclei have axonal extensions to the posterior pituitary.
The most important renal action of ADH is to increase the water permeability  of  the  distal  tubule,  collecting  tubule, and collecting duct epithelia. This effect helps the body to conserve water in circumstances such as dehydration. In the absence of ADH, the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water is low, causing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine, a condition called diabetes insipidus. Thus, the actions of ADH play a key role in controlling the degree of dilution or concentration of the urine.",2,Diabetes mellitus,Diabetes insipidus,Dwarfism,Cretinism,Physiology,,9aea1874-b4cf-4ba0-8de4-ac60866796ba,single,Diabetes insipidus,Diabetes insipidus,1.0,0.8295300602912903,1.0,0.688244104385376,0.689570426940918,2

The restoration of choice is:,"The cast-metal inlay is an alternative to amalgam or composite when the higher strength of a casting alloy is needed or when the superior control of contours and contacts that the indirect procedure provides is desired. The cast-metal onlay is often an excellent alternative to a crown for teeth that have been greatly weakened by caries or by large, failing restorations but where the facial and lingual tooth surfaces are relatively unaffected by disease or injury. For such weakened teeth, the superior physical properties of a casting alloy are desirable to withstand the occlusal loads placed on the restoration; also the onlay can be designed to distribute occlusal loads over the tooth in a manner that decreases the chance of tooth fracture in the future.

"According to scientists, recent studies says about the pattern of enamel prism demineralization, true is:","Enamel is mainly composed of millions of enamel rods or prisms, sheaths and a cementing inter rod substance.
Each rod has a head and tail. 
The head is directed occlusally and the tail is directed cervically. 
Basically, acid etching creates a 5 to 50 micron deep microporous layer into which adhesive resin flows. 
This results in a long-lasting enamel bond achieved via micromechanical interlocking between the resin and enamel.
Etching produces irregular and pitted surface with numerous microscopic undercuts with uneven dissolution of heads and tails, the latter being more resistant.

Vestibuloplasty all are true except:,"Vestibuloplasty
The reduction of alveolar ridge size is frequently accompanied by an apparent encroachment of muscle attachments on the crest of the ridge. These so-called high (mandibular) or low (maxillary) attachments serve to reduce the available denture-bearing area and to undermine denture stability. 
Key concept:
Vestibuloplasty is a soft tissue procedure, and does not necessitate bone grafts.
TYPES OF VESTIBULOPLASTY:-

Mucosal advancement (Submucous) V’plasty:

The mucous membrane of the vestibule is undermined and advanced to line both sides of the extended vestibule.


Secondary epithelization vestibuloplasty:

The mucosa of the vestibule is used to line one side of the extended vestibule, and the other side heals by growing a new epithelial surface.


Grafting vestibuloplasty:

Skin, mucous membrane and dermis can be used as a free graft to line one or both sides of the extended vestibule.",2,Mucosal advancement,Use of hydroxyapatite,Secondary epithelialization,Usage of epithelial grafts,Dental,,39dea240-7448-438e-a215-545b98c8ef65,multi,Use of hydroxyapatite,Use of hydroxyapatite,1.0000001192092896,0.6860034465789795,1.0000001192092896,0.6909675002098083,0.7584615349769592,2

Adverse effects

This class of drugs is notorious for their adverse effects like ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
About 1/5th patients given streptomycin 1 gm BD i.m. experience vestibular disturbances although auditory disturbances are less common. 
Streptomycin has the lowest nephrotoxicity among aminoglycosides; probably because it is not concentrated in the renal cortex.

The following cardiac defects are characterized by ductus dependent blood flow except –,"Congenital heart disease in the newborn can be broadly categorized by the relationship between the patients cardiac defect and the patent ductus arteriosus; this categorization yields four distinct groups:

I. Pulmonary flow ductal dependence.

Newborns with congenital heart disease who are dependent on the potency of their ductus for pulmonary blood flow present with varying degrees of cyanosis.
Critical Pulmonary Valve Stenosis with Intact Ventricular Septum.

Li Tricuspid Atresia:

Tetralogy of Fallot 
	Ni Systemic flow ductal dependence.


These newborns are dependent on their ductus arteriosus for systemic blood flow and unlike the babies who are pulmonary flow dependent, these newborns present with severely decreased cardiac output.
This decreased systemic flow is characterized by pallor, diminished peripheral pulses, low urine output, cool extremities and varying degrees of metabolic acidosis.
This includes newborns with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction at various levels.


Congenital Valvular Aortic Stenosis
Coarctation of the Aorta
Interrupted Aortic Arch
Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)

IlL     xygenation ductal dependence.

Amniotic fluid contains acetyl cholinesterase enzyme. What is the diagnosis ?,"Amniotic fluid Acetylcholineesterase level is elevated in open neural tube defect:

It has a better diagnostic value than AFP.
In case of suspected neural tube defect, on Amniocentesis, if amniotic fluid AFP levels are raised but Acetylcholinesterase levels are normal, patient should be reassured that elevated AFP levels are probably caused by fetal blood contamination but, if acetyl cholinesterase is also elevated along with AFP it is indicative of NTD.
It also helps to distinguish between neural tube defect and abdominal wall defects (both of which cause elevated MSAFP):

– Acetyl cholinesterase is raised in open NTD, but is low in abdominal wall defects.
– In patients with NTD, the ratio of acetylcholinesterase to butyrlcholinesterase levels is 0.14 or more. In case of abdominal wall defects this ratio is less than 0.14.",1,Open spina bifida,Gastroschisis,Omphalocele,Osteogenesis imperfecta,Gynaecology & Obstetrics,,d9f1b19f-12f5-467d-a831-ba3d9020d230,single,Open spina bifida,Open spina bifida,1.0,1.0,0.6875226497650146,0.69550621509552,0.7154613137245178,1

Absolute refractoriness of a neuron is due to?,"Absolute refractory period: The period during which 2nd action potential cannot be elicited, even with strong stimulus is called ""ABSOLUTE REFRACTORY PERIOD"". Reason for this restriction is that sholy after action potential is initiated, the sodium channels (or calcium channels / both) become inactivated & no amount of excitatory signal applied to these channels at this point will open inactivated gates. Only condition that will allow them to reopen is when membrane potential returns to or gets close to original resting membrane potential level. Then, within another small fraction of second, inactivated gates of channels open & new action potential can be initiated This period for large myelinated nerve fibers is about 1/2500 second thus, such fibers can transmit maximum of about 2500 impulses per second - Na have 2 gates, activated gate & an inactivated gate. At resting state - active gate - closed - inactive gate - open At stimulus - both gates are open At absolute refractory period - active gate - open; inactive gate - closed Next action potential is generated only after inactivated gate is open & both gates go back to resting state.",2,Closure of activated Na channels,Closure of inactivated Na channels,Hyperpolarization of CI channels,Opening of rectifier K + channels,Physiology,AIIMS 2017,7d9967cf-83ed-4796-be25-4c0637193d4c,single,Closure of inactivated Na channels,Closure of activated Na channels,0.9714837670326232,0.9999998807907104,0.9714837670326232,0.8404140472412109,0.8322604894638062,1

"Short child with low T4 and raised TSH and swelling of pituitary, what is the diangosis ?","Normally, T4 and T3 exert negative feedback on TSH secretion by pituitary in two ways:


Block the secretion of TSH by pituitary directly --> major action
Block the secretion of TRH by hypothalamus (TRH stimulates the secretion of TSH by pituitary)


In primary hypothyrodism, T4 and T3 are not produced or produced in low concentration by thyroid. This results in abolition of negative feedback on TSH secretion. Thus, there is elevated TSH and pituitary can become hyperplastic to produce more TSH.
In pituitary cause of hypothyroidism (secondary hypothyroidism) both TSH and Thyroid hormone (T4, T3) are low as pituitary does not secrete TSH and TSH is the major stimulation for production of T4 and T3.

About option d

TSH resistance can also produce same picture i.e. raised TSH and low T4 with pituitary swelling.
There is thyroid insensitivity to TSH which results in hypothyroidism (1T4 and T3). Because of reduced thyroid hormone feedback, TSH is markedly elevated.

Which of the following is not used in DIC?,"Well friends, we have discussed the causes and investigations of DIC. Now here let’s take a look at its management.\
Management of DIC

The most important step is to terminate the pregnancy- vaginal delivery without episiotomy is preferred to cesarean section
Volume replacement by crystalloids or colloids will reduce the amount of whole blood needed to restore the blood volume.
500 ml of fresh blood raises the fibrinogen level approximately by 12.5 mg/100 ml and platelets by 10,000–15,000 cu mm. Fresh blood- helps in flushing out fibrin degradation product and improving the micro circulation.
To replace fibrinogen- Fresh frozen plasma should be given: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is extracted from whole blood. It contains fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, clotting factors V, XI, XII. FFP transfusion provides both volume replacement and coagulation factors. One unit of FFP (250 mL) raises the fibrinogen by 5-10 mg/dL. FFP does not need to be ABO or Rh compatible.
Cryoprecipitate is obtained from thawed FFP. It is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, Von Willebrand’s factor, and XIII. Cryoprecipitate provides less volume (40 mL) compared to FFP (250 mL). So it should not be used for volume replacement. One unit of cryoprecipitate increases the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg/dL.
In case of active bleeding with platelet counts < 50,000/ml or prophylactically with platelet count 20–30,000/ml – platelet replacement should be done. Platelet should ABO and Rh specific. 1 units (50 ml) raises the platelet count by 7500/ ml
Recombinant activated factors VIIA: (60-100 μg/kg IV) can reverse DIC within 10 minute as it is a precusor for extrinsic clotting cascade which is replaced.
Role of Heparin

According to Williams Obs. “Heparin is not used in DIC.”
According to COGDT 10/e, p 999
“Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III but has little effect on activated coagulation factors. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with fulminant DIC and central nervous system insults, fulminant liver failure, or obstetric accidents. The one instance, however, in which heparin has been demonstrated to benefit pregnancy-related DIC is in the case of the retained dead fetus with intact vascular system, where heparin may be administered to interrupt the coagulation process and thrombocytopenia for several days until delivery may be implemented.”
As far as EACA is concerned- Williams Obs. 22/e, p 844 says –
“EACA is not recommended in case of DIC.”
According to Williams Obs 23/e, p 787
“It use in most types of obstetric coagulopathy has not been efficacious & not recommended”",2,Heparin,Epsilon amino caproic acid,Blood transfusion,Intravenous fluids.,Gynaecology & Obstetrics,,eb49deaf-5611-4a19-8ad5-0cca73608043,single,Epsilon amino caproic acid,Heparin,0.740459144115448,1.0000001192092896,0.740459144115448,0.6827205419540405,0.6738632321357727,1

The best way to remove a hydrocolloid impression from the patient's mouth is:,"Since alginate is a viscoelastic material, its tear strength is increased when the impression is removed along a vertical path with a snap. The speed of removal must be a compromise between a  rapid movement and a slower rate that is more comfortable for the patient. Usually an alginate impression does not adhere to the oral tissues as well as some of the elastomers do, so it is easier to remove the alginate impression rapidly. However, it is always best to avoid torquing or twisting the impression in an effort to remove it quickly. Specifically, the handle should be used minimally during breaking of the air seal (“suction”) or removal of the tray from the teeth.

"Like all opioids, tramadol acts as an analgesic drug by stimulating mu opioid receptors. Apa from this, the additional mechanism of action of tramadol is?","Ans. A. Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition* Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a m-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinephrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.* Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as duloxetine and venlafaxine.* Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic propey through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the m opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake.* These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.",1,Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition,Anticholinergic,Antihistaminic,Serotonin and dopamine reuptake inhibition,Pharmacology,,6835b5b2-4fda-46a8-b046-5badd11a3560,multi,Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition,Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition,1.0,1.0,0.7257475852966309,0.6980324983596802,0.932569980621338,1

A pregnant lady acquires chickenpox 3 days prior to delivery. She delivers by normal vaginal route which of the following statement is true?,"Varicella infection in pregnancy:

If varicella infection occurs in a pregnant female during first half of pregnancy (M/C time of transmission-13 to 20 weeks) it results in congenital varicella syndrome in the fetus.
Congenital varicella syndrome in characterized by chorioretinitis, microophthalmia, cerebral cortical atrophy, IUGR, hydronephrosis and skin or bone defects.
Congenital varicella syndrome is an indication for doing MTP.
Congenital defects rarely occurs if varicella infection occurs after 20 weeks.
The terminology varicella embryopathy is not used these days.
Neonatal varicella iin characterized by pneumonitis, hepatitis and DIC.
The severity of neonatal infection is inversely related to the concentration of maternal antibodies present in the newborn circulation. Mother starts producing and transferring antibodies approximately 5 days after the onset of her disease.Thus, babies born 5 days or more from the beginning of maternal disease will be protected.

Fernando Arias 3/e, p 156

Perinatal varicella exposure just before or during delivery poses a serious threat to newborns and so Varicella Ig should be given to all neonates of born to mothers who have clinical evidence of varicella 5 days before and upto 2 days after delivery.
The use of VZIG decreases the chances of neonatal varicella and also modify the clinical course but it does not always prevent severe or fatal varicella. Expectant treatment with close observation, followed by prompt initiation of antiviral therapy on suspicion of neonatal varicella is recommended.

A radiograph is shown below. This type of root morphology has highest incidence in which population?,"A variation in root morphology is the presence of an extra distolingual root. Usually, this root has a type 1 canal configuration. Two-thirds of the first mandibular molars found in a Chinese population had this variation. Similarly, this distolingual root occurred in 4% of mandibular first molars of a Kuwaiti population. These results confirm the observation that East Asian populations have more three-rooted mandibular first molars than do other racial groups. Mandibular molars, mainly first molars, may also have an additional root located lingually or buccally. Although this is a rare occurrence in Caucasian populations, it is more common in Asian populations. The radix entomolaris (RE) is a supernumerary root located distolingually in mandibular molars, whereas the radix paramolaris (RP) is an extra root located mesiobuccally. Each root usually contains a single root canal. The orifice of the RE is located distolingually to mesiolingually from the main canal or canals of the distal root; the orifice of the RP is located mesiobuccally to distobuccally from the main mesial root canals.

Major mechanism of action of nitrates in acute attack of angina is:,"Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload.

Umblical cord contains:,"A patent opening called the primitive umbilical ring exists on the ventral surface of the developing embryo through which three structures pass: the yolk sac (vitelline duct), connecting stalk, and allantois. The allantois is not functional in humans and degenerates to form the median umbilical ligament in the adult.
As the amnion expands, it pushes the vitelline duct, connecting stalk, and allantois together to form the primitive umbilical cord.
The definitive umbilical cord at term is pearl-white, 1–2 cm in  diameter,  50–60  cm  long, eccentrically  positioned,  and contains the right and left umbilical arteries, left umbilical vein, and mucus connective tissue (Wharton’s jelly).
The right and left umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta. The left umbilical vein carries oxygenated blood from the placenta to the fetus.

Doc of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is,"- Metronidazole is drug of choice for bacterial vaginosis ( with or without pregnancy )- Alternative to metronidazole is clindamycin.- Rovamycin i.e. spiramycin (which is a macrolide) is drug of choice for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. Metronidazole -* It is the prototype nitroimidazole having broad-spectrum cidal activity against anaerobic protozoa, including Giardia lamblia , trichomonas and amoeba. * Many anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria, such as Bact. fragilis, Fusobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, peptococci, spirochetes and anaerobic Streptococci are sensitive. * Metronidazole does not affect aerobic bacteria. Mechanism of action- After entering the cell by diffusion, its nitro group is reduced by ceain redox proteins operative only in anaerobic microbes to a highly reactive nitro radical which exes cytotoxicity. The nitro radical of metronidazole acts as an electron sink which competes with the biological electron acceptors of the anaerobic organism for the electrons generated by the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway of pyruvate oxidation. The energy metabolism of anaerobes that have no mitochondria is thus, disrupted. Aerobic environment attenuates cytotoxicity of metronidazole by inhibiting its reductive activation. Moreover, O2 competes with the nitro radical of metronidazole for the free electrons generated during energy metabolism of anaerobes. Metronidazole, in addition, has been found to inhibit cell mediated immunity, to induce mutagenesis and to cause radiosensitization.

All of the following are characteristic features of Tricuspid Atresia except –,"Atresia of the tricuspid valve results in the absence of a communication between the right atrium and right ventricle therefore the right ventricle is underdeveloped the inflow portion being absent.
The only exit for systemic venous blood coming to the right atrium is by way ofAtrial Septal defect. Through this the blood goes to left atrium from where it enters left ventricle.
A ventricular septal defect provides communication between the left ventricle and the outflow portion of the right ventricle. The left ventricle therefore maintain both the systemic as well as the pulmonary circulation thus there is hypertrophy of the left ventricle which is reflected by left axis deviation in ECG.
The pulmonary blood flow is dependent on the size of the ventricular defect, the smaller the VSD, the lesser the pulmonary blood flow. 90% patients of Triscuspid Atresia have diminished pulmonary blood flow.

All of the following are induction agents except:September 2007,"Ans. C: Nitrous oxideGeneral anaesthesia can be induced by intravenous (IV) injection, or breathing a volatile anaesthetic through a facemask (inhalational induction).Onset of anaesthesia is faster with IV injection than with inhalation, taking about 10-20 seconds to induce total unconsciousness.This has the advantage of avoiding the excitatory phase of anaesthesia, and thus reduces complications related to induction of anaesthesia.An inhalational induction may be chosen by the anesthesiologist where IV access is difficult to obtain, where difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or due to patient preference (e.g. children).Commonly used IV induction agents include propofol, sodium thiopental, etomidate, and ketamine.The most commonly-used agent for inhalational induction is sevoflurane because it causes less irritation than other inhaled gasesIn order to prolong anaesthesia for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. Usually this is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and a volatile anaesthetic agent or by having a carefully controlled infusion of medication, usually propofol, through an IV.Induction Characteristics & Dosage Requirements for Currently AvailableSedative & Hypnotic DrugsDrug NameInduction Dose (mg/kg)Onset (sec)Duration (min)Thiopental3-6<305-10Methohexital1-3<305-10Propofol1.5-2.515-455-10Midazolam0.2-0,430-9010-30Diazepam0.3-0.645-9015-30Lorazepam0.03-0.0660-12060-120Etomidate0.2-0.33-123-12Ketamine1-210-2010-20",3,Thiormtal,Halothane,Nitrous oxide,Propofol,Anaesthesia,,7e38cd45-2858-4483-b448-d461bde268ee,multi,Nitrous oxide,Nitrous oxide,0.9999998807907104,0.6879411339759827,0.7814276814460754,0.9999998807907104,0.7277875542640686,3

Infective endocarditis is most commonly seen in:,"Infective endocarditis typically occurs at sites of pre-existing endocardial damage, but infection with particularly virulent or aggressive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus can cause endocarditis in a previously normal heart. Staphylococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve is a common complication of intravenous drug use. Many acquired and congenital cardiac lesions are vulnerable, particularly areas of endocardial damage caused by a high-pressure jet of blood, such as ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, many of which are haemodynamically insigniﬁcant. In contrast, the risk of endocarditis at the site of haemodynamically important low-pressure lesions, such as a large atrial septal defect, is minimal.

The highest risk associated with the use of oral contraceptives is in:,"Serious Complications

Leg vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: The older preparations increased the incidence of venous thromboembolism, but this is found to be less marked (only 2-3 patients per 1000 women years) with the newer reduced steroid content pills. However, even low-dose pills pose significant risk in women > 35 years of age, diabetics, hypertensives and in those who smoke. The excess risk is due to the estrogen component of the OC, and normalizes shortly after stopping the OC.
Rise in BP: Occurred in 5-10% women taking the earlier pills. The again is less frequent and smaller in magnitude with the low-dose pills of today. If the BP rises, best is to stop OCs: the BP normalizes in the next 3-6 months. Both the estrogen and progestin components are responsible for this effect, probably by increasing plasma angiotensinogen level and renin activity which have been found to be raised during OC use. Aldosterone secretion is enhanced resulting in salt and water retention.

What is responsible for rhythm generation of inspiration?,Ans. B. Pre botzinger complexRhythmic respiration is initiated by a small group of synaptically coupled pacemaker cells in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BOTC) on either side of the medulla between the nucleus ambiguus and the lateral reticular nucleus.The main components of the respiratory control pattern generator responsible for automatic respiration are located in the medulla.Rhythmic respiration is initiated by a small group of synaptically coupled pacemaker cells in the pre-Botzinger complex (pre-BOTC) on either side of the medulla between the nucleus ambiguus and the lateral reticular nucleus.,2,Dorsal nucleus of vagus,Pre botzinger complex,ventral respiratory neurons,Pneumotaxic center,Physiology,,9a97b879-df24-4f11-b1b4-d3c64a3a5fc7,single,Pre botzinger complex,Pre botzinger complex,0.9999998807907104,0.6610739827156067,0.9999998807907104,0.6889944672584534,0.6920037269592285,2

Anchorage not being applied here:,"Different types of anchorage
Intraoral Anchorage

Anchorage units are present within the oral cavity.
Anchorage sources can be teeth, palate, etc.

Simple Anchorage

When application of force tends to change the axial inclination of the tooth or teeth that form the anchorage unit in the plane of space in which the force is being applied.

Stationary anchorage

Anchor tooth or source does not move against the forces of teeth.
In real sense, only the extra-oral source of anchorage like can be from headgears would be anchorage.
Anchor tooth being housed in a bioactive environment would show some degree of movement and hence cannot be classified as stationary anchorage in a real sense.

Reciprocal Anchorage:

Teeth which are pulled against each other to close spaces.
Midline diastema in the upper arch with elastic arch.
Cross elastics to correct molar cross-bite.
Arch expansion using a midline screw.
The molar rotator.

 Single or Primary Anchorage

The tooth to be moved against a tooth which can have greater alveolar support area.
Like a molar along with adjacent premolars used to align another molar.

Compound Anchorage

The use of more teeth with greater anchorage potential to move a tooth or group of teeth with lesser support.
Like in the fixed orthodontic appliances retracting incisors using loop mechanics.

Reinforced Anchorage

Reinforcing of anchorage units by use of more than one type of resistance units.
Like headgears along with routine fixed mechano-therapy or (extra-oral anchorage and intra arch compound anchorage)

Key Concept: 
Since the figure shows the movement of both the units towards each other, this doesn’t fit the definition of stationary anchorage.",2,Reciprocal,Stationary,Intramaxillary,Intraoral,Dental,,149f4170-803d-4034-acb3-776c0abd48b5,single,Stationary,Stationary,1.0000003576278689,0.8790639042854309,1.0000001192092896,0.6817200183868408,0.7132754325866699,2

Bacteriocidal toxin is found in:,"The reaction of the periradicular tissues to noxious products of tissue necrosis, bacterial products and antigenic agents from the root canal has been described by Fish.
The four zones 

Zone of infection
Zone of contamination
Zone of irritation
Zone of stimulation


Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.
The bacterial toxins are found in this zone.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's. It contains cholesterol crystals.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)

"The strength of a gypsum investment is dependent
on:","α-hemihydrate of gypsum, and quartz or cristobalite are forms of silica. Most investments contain the α-hemihydrate of gypsum, because of its greater strength. This gypsum product serves as a binder for the other ingredients and to provide rigidity. The strength of the investment is dependent on the amount of binder used. The investment powder may contain 25% to 45% of calcium sulfate hemihydrate. Gypsum shrinks considerably, when it is heated. If the proper forms of silica are employed in the investment, this contraction during heating can be eliminated and changed to an expansion.

"A 10 year old patient reported to department with BCLP (bilateral cleft lip & palate); the maxillary transverse width was normal, lateral incisor was congenitally missing with impacted canine. What will be the treatment approach?","Timing of SABG surgery:
Secondary alveolar bone grafting (SABG) is done at an age when the growth inhibition effects of the surgery on maxilla are minimised, and it can help the maxillary canine or lateral incisor to erupt normally through the cancellous bone. After the age of 9 years, maxillary growth is minimal. Secondary bone grafting is done during the mixed dentition stage after the eruption of permanent incisors, but before the eruption of permanent canines. The timing of bone graft is based on the root formation and eruption pattern of the maxillary lateral incisor and maxillary canine. In case, insufficient bone is available in the cleft area for the lateral incisors to erupt, bone graft can be done around 7 years of age.
Note: In this patient, since the transverse width is normal, there is no need for expansion.

""Delivery by caesarian section and gestational age are the risk factors for TTN"". —Articles Obs & Gynae Transient tachvpnea of Newborn (TTN) 

Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a benign self-limiting disease occuring usually in term neonates and is due to delayed clearance of lung fluid.
It is also called respiratory distress syndrome type H
TTN follows -


Uneventful normal preterm or term vaginal delivery
Cesarean delivery


TTN is believed to be secondary to slow absorption of fetal lung fluid resulting in decreased pulmonary compliance and tidal volume and increased dead space therefore also known as wet lung.
Clinical manifestations


Early onset of tachypnea

El Sometimes refraction or expiratory grunting
u Occasionally cyanosis

Patients usually recover rapidly within 3 days.

A radiograph of the mandibular posteriors in a patient reveals radiopacity above the apices of right 1st molar. No restoration or cavity present. There is no pain or swelling and the pulp is vital. The diagnosis is:,"Radiographic Features:
The tumor mass is attached to the tooth root and appears as a well-circumscribed dense radiopaque mass often surrounded by a thin, uniform radiolucent line. The outline of the affected root is generally obliterated, because of resorption of the root and fusion of the mass to the tooth.
The associated tooth is vital, unless coincidentally involved. The lesion is slow-growing and may cause expansion of cortical plates of bone, but is usually otherwise asymptomatic.

A 10 days old neonate is posted for pyloric stenosis in surgery. The investigation report shows a serum calcium level of 6 mg/dL. What information would you like to know before you supplement calcium to this neonate –,"Normal calcium level is 8.9-10.1 mg/dl (total calcium).
Slightly less than half of the total serum calcium exists in free or ionized form. Remainder is bound to protein (mostly albumin). ionized calcium is relevant for cell fuction.

""There are few clinical situations in which the total calcium is not an adequate surrogate for the ionized Ca++ concentration. The most common and severe problem is the presence of hypoalbuminemia"".

Each 1 gin/di of albumin in the serum binds about 0.8 mg/dl of calcium.
A low total calcium concentration may be normal in a patient with significant hypoalbuminemia.

"A gravida 2 patient with previous LSCS comes at 37 weeks, has BP= 150/100 mm of hg. And on pervaginal examination, cervix is 50% effaced station-3, os is closed and pelvis is adequate. Protein uria is +1, Most appropriate step at the moment would be:","This patient has

BP: 150/100 mm hg
Proteinuria: +1

Therefore it is classified as mild preeclampsia
In mild preeclampsia – if gestational age is > than labour induced should be 37 wks (here in the question = gestational age is >37 weeks). Here BP is 150/100, (Therefore, it is not necessary to start antihypertensive). The NICE clinical guidelines suggest treating moderate hypertension (BP-150/100-159/109 mm Hg) with antihypertensives to keep B I P <150/80-100 range. The benefits or disadvantages of this intervention have not been elucidated by adequate clinical trials.
Fernando Arias 4/e, p 209.
“There is a consensus that if BP is below 150/100 mm Hg, there is no need for antihypertensive therapy. An exception may be if mild hypertension is associated with markers of potential severe disease or sign of organ dysfunction, (heavy proteinuria, liver dysfunction, hematological dysfuntion)”.
Fernando Arias 4/e, p 209.
Thus, in this patient, the role of antihypertensive is not confirmatory as BP is 150/100 mm Hg. But role of induction of labor is confirmed, as patient is 37 weeks pregnant with mild hypertension.
PIH is not a contraindication for VBAC (Vaginal birth after cesarean) and further more that the pelvis of this patient is adequate – so there is no harm in inducing labour, rather it is advantageous, because it will help in developing lower uterine segment. At any point of time; if there is scar tenderness or if patients BP rises immediately perform cesarean section’ therefore the best answer here is – Antihypertensive regime and then induce labour",3,Antihypertensive regime and wait for spontaneous labor,Wait and watch,Induce labour,caesarean section,Gynaecology & Obstetrics,,3717f6b4-9504-4284-be95-e2f899c94187,multi,Induce labour,Antihypertensive regime and then induce labour,0.8090474605560303,0.935571789741516,0.6341699361801147,0.8090474605560303,0.6640908718109131,1

Heavy and light body impression materials are used with:,"Elastomeric impression materials:
They are supplied in two components, a base paste and a catalyst paste (or liquid) that are mixed before making impressions. They are often formulated in several consistencies, including extra low, low, medium, heavy, and putty, in increasing order of filler content. Extra-low and putty forms are available only for condensation and addition silicones.
Polysulfide is provided only in light-body and heavy-body consistencies. There is no heavy-body product for condensation silicone. Pigments are added to give each material a distinct color.
The base paste, is a polysulfide polymer that contains a multifunctional mercaptan (-SH) called a polysulfide polymer, a suitable  filler  (such as lithopone or titanium dioxide) to provide the required strength, a plasticizer (such as dibutyl phthalate) to confer the appropriate viscosity to the paste, and a small quantity of sulfur, approximately 0.5%, as an accelerator.

A6 month old child with Tetralogy of Fallot develops cyanotic spell initiated by crying. Which one of the following drugs you would like to avoid –,"In Tetralogy of Fallot there is right outflow obstruction due to pulmonary stenosis with supravalvular pulmonary artery obstruction.


In case of severe obstruction, the right ventricular pressure becomes greater than the left ventricular presence and the deoxygenated blood starts moving to the left ventricle resulting in severe cyanosis and erythrocytosis.
In this situation the aim is to increase blood flow towards the right heart. The methods adopted are compression of Aorta (knee chest position) and use of vasopressor drugs like methoxamine (Phenylepinephrine is also a vasopressor).
Any condition or drug which causes peripheral pooling of blood should be avoided because this will reduce return of blood to heart.
Therefore isoprenaline which has marked 13, agonistic action should be avoided as it will cause vasodilatation which leads to peripheral pooling of blood.

Major mechanism of action of nitrates in acute attack of angina is:-,"Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload.

Irradiation - reduces the chance of development of Graft Versus Host Disease. Irradiation - causes - reduction in the number of the immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes mainly) Irradiation of cellular blood components (red blood cells, platelets, and granulocytes) is indicated to prevent the development of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Patients at risk of TA-GVHD include immunocompromised patients who are receiving a bone marrow or stem cell transplant and fetuses undergoing an intrauterine transfusion. Irradiation is also indicated for recipients of components collected from a blood relative or HLA-matched donors. 3. Leukocyte reduction - Leukoreduction of whole blood and blood components has been shown to reduce recurrent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, reduce alloimmunization to leukocyte antigens that may complicate care of patients whoundergo transplantation or chronic transfusion therapy, and protect against transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to patients at increased risk of CMV disease. antibodies in the recipient - react with donor leukocytes - release of cytokines - cause fever- known as Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction. 4.

Impression compound base:,"Impression compound 
The thermal conductivity of these materials is very low, indicating the need to allow an extended time to achieve thorough cooling and heating of the compound. The material should be uniformly soft at the time it is placed in the tray and thoroughly cooled in the tray before the impression is withdrawn from the mouth. Cold water can be sprayed on the tray while it is in the mouth until the compound is thoroughly hardened prior to removal of the impression tray.
Failure to attain a complete hardening of the material before withdrawing the impression can result in a significant distortion of the impression by relaxation.

A 5–years old male child presents with episodic anaemia and jaundice since birth. He is least likely to have which of the following,"Causes of Jaundice since birth are:

(i) Rh incompatibility (erythroblastosis fetalis)
ABO incompatibility

Congenital infections (TORCH)
Sepsis
Concealed hemorrhage
Red cell membrane defect (hereditary spherocytosis)
Red cell enzyme defect (G6PD deficiency)


So, option a & d can cause jaundice since birth.
In sickle cell anemia, affected infants do not develop symptoms in the first few months of life because the hemoglobin produced by the developing fetus (fetal hemoglobin) protects the red blood cells from sickling. This fetal hemoglobin disappears after 5 month of age so that by 5 months of age, the sickling of the red blood cells is prominent and symptoms begin.
PNH is manfested in adults.
So, both PNH and sickle cell anemia does not cause jaundice since birth.
But among these two I would prefer PNH as the answer because it is manifested in adulthood while the patient in question is a 5-years old child.

Which of the following alloys has the highest coeﬃcient of friction?,"The surface of NiTi is rougher (because of surface defects, not the quality of polishing) than that of beta-Ti, which in turn is rougher than steel. However, there is little or no correlation for orthodontic wires between the coefficients of friction and surface roughness. (i.e., interlocking and plowing are not significant components of the total frictional resistance). 
Although NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance, it turns out that as the titanium content of an alloy increases, its surface reactivity increases, and the surface chemistry is a major influence on frictional behavior. Thus, beta-Ti, at 80% titanium, has a higher coefficient of friction than NiTi at 50% titanium, and there is greater frictional resistance to sliding with either than with steel.
Key Concept
Although NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance.

Which of the following is a primarily RNA based technique?,"PCR is Reverse Transcriptase PCR, where staing material is RNA. It is used to make cDNA, which is amplified. Thus RNA can be amplified by this method and quantification of mRNA can also be done (see fig). Here we use Tth polymerase enzyme which has both reverse transcriptase and polymerase activity WITH REGARD TO OTHER OPTIONS: Western blot is to detect protein. Next generation sequencing & Sanger's technique are for DNA sequencing. ADDITIONAL EDGE: Used to detect RNA expression Sample here is RNA. This RNA is conveed to cDNA by enzyme reverse transcriptase. Tth polymerase (Thermus thermophilus HB-8) has Polymerase as well as reverse transcriptase activity when mixed with manganese ions and can thus be used for the amplification of RNA to cDNA. This polymerase is thermostable but does not has proofreading activity. So it is usually combined with a proofreading enzyme.",2,Next generation sequencing,PCR,Sanger's technique,Western blotting,Biochemistry,AIIMS 2018,42f5106c-e964-4e2c-b39d-b95f6246efae,single,PCR,PCR,0.9999995827674866,0.739249050617218,0.9999995827674866,0.6783110499382019,0.6757498979568481,2

Reticulocytosis is seen in:,"Red cell precursors formed in the bone marrow from the erythroid (CFU–E) progenitor cells are called erythroblasts or normoblasts. These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The ﬁrst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (‘polychromasia’). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.
Proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.

"Peau d'Orange of breast is due to:September 2005, 2010, March 2007","Ans. B: Obstruction of lymphatic ductsInflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a very aggressive type of breast cancer in which the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast.This type of breast cancer is called ""inflammatory"" because the breast often looks swollen and red, or ""inflamed"", sometimes overnight, and can be misdiagnosed as mastitis.Invasion of the local lymphatic ducts impairs drainage and causes edematous swelling of the breast. Because the skin of the breast is tethered by the suspensory ligament of Cooper, the accumulation of fluid may cause the skin of the breast to assume a dimpled appearance similar to an orange peel (peau d'orange).IBC is sometimes misdiagnosed as an insect bite or breast infection.

"A patient was schedule for surgery. Before giving anaesthesia, he was administered glycopyrrolate. What is rationale of giving glycopyrrolate before anaesthesia?",Preanaesthetic medication refers to the use of drugs before anaesthesia to make it safe and less unpleasant. When inhalation anaesthetic are given they inhibit the ciliary function therefore secretions in the respiratory pathway are not removed so we have to stop the secretions by administration of anti cholinergic drugs like atropine or glycopyrrolate. Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent and longer acting quaternary antimuscarinic which does not produce central effects. Antisecretory action is more marked than atropine and tachycardia is less marked. It acts rapidly when given i.v. and is the preferred antimuscarinic in anaesthetic practice.,2,To allay anxiety,To decrease secretions,As inducing agent,For muscle relaxation,Pharmacology,AIIMS 2019,9faa00b2-c959-441b-a202-4667f165ba64,multi,To decrease secretions,To decrease secretions,1.0000001192092896,0.7793903350830078,1.0000001192092896,0.7491644024848938,0.743349015712738,2

Poisoning by which of these elements causes blind staggers alkali disease in livestock?,"Ans: C. SeleniumBlind staggers are no longer believed to be caused by selenium but by sulfate toxicity due to the consumption of high-sulfate alkali water and/or high sulfur-containing forages.Since Sulfate is not mentioned in Question we will go for selenium.Excess sulfate (>1% of diet) leads to polioencephalomalacia and the classical signs of blind staggers.Blind StaggersThis syndrome may occur within a brief period (a few days to a few weeks) after the animal has begun to take in very high dietary levels of selenium. The symptoms of this condition are: impaired vision, a depressed appetite, and wandering in circlesProlonged oral exposure of cattle to elevated dietary selenium (Se) is associated historically with 2 clinical syndromes:Alkali disease.""Blind staggers"".These two syndromes are not necessarily independent of one another.

"In intraoral radiograph, patient radiation is decreased by
all except:","Kilovoltage:
The optimal operating potential of dental X-ray units is between 60 and 70 kVp (ADA 2012).
Although image diagnosis may be improved slightly with increased image contrast (low kVp) images, the patient dose is reduced with higher kVp exposures. Most intraoral machines use 60 to 70 kVp. The availability of constant-potential (fully rectified), high-frequency or direct current (DC) dental X-ray units have made possible the production of radiographs with lower kilovoltage and at reduced levels of radiation. The surface exposure required to produce a comparable radiographic density using a constant-potential unit is approximately 25% less than that of a conventional self-rectified unit operating at the same kilovoltage. At the present time, several manufacturers produce DC units.
Thus, in intraoral radiograph, patient radiation is not decreased by decreasing kVp.

Transfontanellar USG shows a hypoechoic midline mass with dilated lateral ventricles. Most likely diagnosis is –","Midline intracranial mass with bruit on ausculation and features of hydrocephalus and congestive heart failure ­All point towards Vein of Galen Malformation.

Vein of Galen Malformations(VGM) 

The vein of Galen is a large deep vein at the base of the brain. It is located under the cerebral hemispheres and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the sinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa .
VGM results from an aneurysmal malformation with an arteriovenous shunting of blood.VGM usually causes high-output heart failure in the newborn resulting from the decreased resistance and high blood flow in the lesion.
Associated findings include cerebral ischemic changes such as strokes or steal phenomena that result in progressive hemiparesis.
The malformation may result in mass effects, causing progressive neurological impairment. Alternatively, the malformation may cause obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow and result in hydrocephalus.
Loud intracranial bruit may be heard because of the blood turbulence in VGM.
The most effective treatment for the malformation has been embolization rather than surgery

Which stage of plasmodium vivax is infective to mosquito?,"When certain forms of blood stage parasites (gametocytes, which occur in male and female forms) are ingested during blood feeding by a female Anopheles mosquito, they mate in the gut of the mosquito and begin a cycle of growth and multiplication in the mosquito. 
After 10-18 days, a form of the parasite called a sporozoite migrates to the mosquito’s salivary glands. 
When the Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal on another human, anticoagulant saliva is injected together with the sporozoites, which migrate to the liver, thereby beginning a new cycle.

Cholesterol crystals are found in which zone?,"The reaction of the periradicular tissues to noxious products of tissue necrosis, bacterial products and antigenic agents from the root canal has been described by Fish.
The four zones 

Zone of infection
Zone of contamination
Zone of irritation
Zone of stimulation


Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's. It contains cholesterol crystals.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.
In this zone, the eﬀects of toxins were mild enough to be stimulant which results in laying down of collagen ﬁbers around the zone of irritation that acts both as a wall of defense and as a scaﬀolding on which the osteoblasts built new bone.

"An 8 year old child got trauma and got his central incisor avulsed 20 minutes back which got contaminated with debris. The child rushes to dental clinic with avulsed tooth, the treatment is:","If the tooth has been out for 15 minutes to 60 minutes:
Tooth with closed apex

Clean the root surface with saline.
Do not touch a viable root with hands, forceps, gauze or anything, or try to scrub or clean it to avoid injury to
the periodontal ligament which makes it difficult to revascularize the reimplanted tooth.
Examine alveolar socket after cleaning it with saline. Do not overlook fracture of tooth and alveolar ridge.
Reimplant the tooth gently with firm finger pressure. Ask the patient to bite down firmly on a piece of gauze to help stabilize the tooth.
After evaluating the occlusion, stabilize the tooth if required. Ideal splint required for an avulsed tooth is a flexible splint. The commonly used flexible splints are made of Gortex, metallic mesh stripes, synthetic clothes or orthodontic wire. A thick strip of composite bonded to the avulsed and the adjacent teeth also act as a splint.

The splint should engage several teeth around the avulsed tooth and it should be kept in place for not more than 7 to 10 days.

Continue with the same treatment as above.

Tooth with open apex:

Clean the root surface with saline.
Examine the alveolar socket after cleaning it with saline.
Cover the root surface with minocycline hydrochloride microspheres before reimplanting to kill bacteria which could enter the immature apex and form an abscess.
Continue with the same treatment as above.

Cerebral palsy (CP)

Cerebral palsy is defined as a non progressive neuromotor disorder of cerebral origin.
It has following features -


Static (nonprogressive)
Disorder of movement/motor disorder (but sometimes sensory involvement may occur)
Cerebral in origin 
Etiopathogenesis


CP is due to an insult of developing brain.
The insult results in maldevelopment and disorderly anatomic organization of the brain.
The insult may be prenatal (most of the cases), during delivery or in the postnatal period. Classification

Maximum strain of parturient heart occurs during:,"“Significant hemodynamic alterations are apparent early in pregnancy, women with severe cardiac dysfunction may experience worsening of heart failure before mid pregnancy. In others, heart failure develops after 28 weeks, when pregnancy induced hypervolemia is maximal (32 weeks).

Williams 22/e, p 1018, 23/e, p 958, 959
Reading the above text, from Williams Obs., it is clear that maximum chances of heart failure are in the peripartum period.
But it is not clear whether maximum chances are during labour or immediate postpartum.
Dutta Obs. 7/e, p53 provides answer to this:
“The cardiac output starts to increase from 5th week of pregnancy, reaches its peak 40-50% at about 30-34 weeks. Thereafter the cardiac output remains static till term”.
“Cardiac output increases further during labour (+50%) and immediately following delivery (+70%) over the pre labour values.”

"A patient is giving; history of avulsed tooth 20 minutes back, comes to dentist what should be done?","If a patient provided history that a tooth has been avulsed and it can be determined that the injury is without other oral. neurologic, or higher-priority physical complications. it is best to replace it in the socket immediately and to hold it in place with light finger pressure.
If the avulsion occurred in a clean environment, nothing should be done to the tooth before replants it. If the tooth is dirty, an attempt should be made to clean the root surface, but it is very important to preserve any remnants of the periodontal ligament that are still attached to the root. 'therefore the parent would then be instructed to keep the tooth immersed in a suitable storage medium and bring the child and the tooth for immediate care.
The patient should receive immediate attention after arriving at the dental office; and if it seems any contamination than it should be rinse thoroughly with saline only do not attempt to scrub tooth by any means to prevent vitality of periodontal fibers and re-implant it in socket.
If patient or parent cannot or will not replant it than procedure to maintain vitality of tooth
Allowing the avulsed tooth to dehydrate before replantation is damaging to a favourable prognosis.
Hanks buffered saline, isotonic saline, and pasteurized bovine milk may be the most favourable known storage media. If none of these solutions is readily available, human saliva is acceptable short-term substitute storage liquid. Presumably, the patient's saliva (and perhaps blood) would be readily available.
Although tap water has been a commonly recommended storage solution (and its use would be preferable to allowing dehydration of the tooth), saliva is a better storage medium. Neither water nor saliva is as good as milk or saline, if the tooth must be stored for a long period (more than 30 minutes before replantation).

Disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus which is not mediated through a toxin is,"Answer- B.

Clinically, Staphylococcus aureus sepsis presents like that documented for sepsis due to other bacteria. Septicemic shock is not directly caused due to toxins and other virulence factors play a role like protein A, fibrinolysin and coagulase, which are anti-phagocytic, suppress host immunity and helps in the spread of infection. Septicemia is mainly due to endotoxin tike activity as seen in Gram-negative bacilli and not due to exotoxin. S.aureus produces free types of toxin: cytotoxins, pyrogenic toxin superantigens, and exfoliative toxins.

Drug acting on cell wall of gram positive bacteria:March 2009,"Ans. D: VancomycinVancomycins bind to the peptides of the peptidoglycan monomers and block both the formation of gycosidic bonds between the sugars by the transgycosidase enzymes and the formation of the peptide cross-links by the transpeptidase enzymes. This results in a weak cell wall and osmotic lysis of the bacterium.The fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, etc.) work by inhibiting one or more of a group of enzymes called topoisomerase, enzymes needed for supercoiling, replication and separation of circular bacterial DNA.For example, DNA gyrase is a topoisomerase that catalyzes the negative supercoiling of the circular DNA found in bacteria. Topoisomerase IV, on the other hand, is involved in the relaxation of the supercoiled circular DNA, enabling the separation of the interlinked daughter chromosomes at the end of bacterial DNA replication.In gram-positive bacteria, the main target for fluoroquinolones is DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), an enzyme responsible for supercoiling of bacterial DNA during DNA replication; in gram-negative bacteria, the primary target is topoisomerase IV, an enzyme responsible for relaxation of supercoiled circular DNA and separation of the inter-linked daughter chromosomes.The tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, demeclocycline, minocycline, etc.) block bacterial translation by binding reversibly to the 30S subunit and distoing it in such a way that the anticodons of the charged tRNAs cannot align properly with the codons of the mRNA.The aminoglycosides (streptomycin, neomycin, netilmicin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin, etc.) bind irreversibly to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.",4,Gentamycin,Ciprofloxacin,Tetracycline,Vancomycin,Pharmacology,,643e9f4a-030c-45b2-867a-2393445afea3,multi,Vancomycin,Vancomycin,0.9999998211860656,0.8858820199966431,0.7435852885246277,0.7063267827033997,0.9999998211860656,4

Which of the following drugs is least efficacious in the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy?,"Complex partial seizures (CPS, temporal lobe epilepsy, psychomotor): attacks of bizarre and confused behaviour dream-like state and purposeless movements, or even walking, unaware emotional changes lasting 1-2 min along with impairment of consciousness. The patient has no recollection of the attack. An aura often precedes. The seizure focus is located in the temporal lobe.​
Phenobarbitone was the first efficacious anti-epileptic introduced in 1912.​
Primidone A deoxybarbiturate, which is converted by liver to phenobarbitone and phenylethyl malonamide (PEMA). Its antiepileptic activity is mainly due to these active metabolites because t1/2 of primidone (6-14 hr) is less than that of its active metabolites. About 1/3 primidone is excreted unchanged by kidney. Dose to dose primidone is less potent, but antiepileptic efficacy is similar to phenobarbitone. It is seldom used now in GTGC and partial epilepsy, mainly as an adjuvant to phenytoin or carbamazepine.
Adverse effects are similar to phenobarbitone. In addition, anemia, leukopenia, psychotic reaction and lymph node enlargement occur rarely.
Dose: Start with 250 mg OD, then 250-500 mg BD, children 10-20 mg/kg/day.

"Phosphate bonded investment should be completely carbon free, otherwise:","Carbon is often added to the powder to produce clean castings and facilitate the divesting of the casting from the investment mold. This addition is appropriate when the casting alloy is gold, but there is disagreement regarding the effects of carbon in phosphate investments used for casting silver-palladium alloys, palladium-silver alloys, or base metal alloys. It is believed that carbon can embrittle the alloys, even though the investment is heated to temperatures that burn out the carbon. Some evidence indicates that palladium reacts with carbon at temperatures above 1504 °C. Thus, if the casting temperature of an alloy with high palladium content exceeds this critical point, a phosphate investment without carbon should be used.

Following are true about bronchial cyst except –,"Only 15% of bronchogenic cysts occur in lungs (pulmonary parenchyma).
Bronchogenic cysts 
Bronchogenic cyst is a congenital lung defect, which develops from abnormal lung budding of primitive foregut.
Most of the bronchogenic cyst arise in the mediastinum, where they are usually located in the mid mediastinum  near carina. 
About 15% of Bronchogenic cyst also occurs in pulmonary parenchyma.
When located in the lung they are more common in right lung and lower lobe.
They are lined by cuboidal or ciliated columnar epithelial cells and are usually filled with mucoid material. Complications of Bronchogenic cyst :-
Infection of the cyst leading to lung abscess (illediastinal bronchogenic cysts do not communicate with the bronchi but those situated within the lung may communicate with the airways leading to abscess formation).
Compression can produce either hyperinflation of the lung or atelactasis due to obstruction.

Congenital diaphrogmatic hernia

Also known as ochalek hernia.
There is herniation of abdominal contents, i.e. stomach (most of the time), intestine, liver; into thorax through a defect in the diaphragm.
Females are affected more than males
More common on left side and is posterolateral.
Components of CDH are


Herniation of abdominal contents into thorax
Pulmonary hypoplasia
Malrotation of intestine


Associated anomalies may be seen 30% of cases -> CNS lesions, esophageal atresia, omphalocele and CVS lesions.
Most cases are sporadic.
CDH is a reconized part of several chromosomal syndromes ---> Trisomy 21, 18, 13, turner syndrome, Pallister-Killian, Fryn.

Clinical features

CDH may present as


Soon (within 6 hrs) after birth (most of the cases)
	or
After neonatal period (small group)

1)   Soon after birth

Respiratory distress is a cardinal sign --> presents as tachypnea, grunting, chest retraction, cyanosis.
Scaphoid abdomen
Increased chest wall diameter
Bowel sounds may be heard in the chest with decreased breath sound.


Cardiac impulse is displaced away from the side of hernia.

2)   After neonatal period

Vomiting as a result of intestinal obstruction
Mild respiratory symptoms


Occasionally, incarceration of the intestine will proceed to ischemia with sepsis and shock.

In which of the following conditions would maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values be the highest:,"Friends, many questions are asked on serum alpha fetoprotein, therefore basic knowledge of this protein is quite vital.
Alpha Fetoprotein:

It is a glycoprotein synthesized by the fetal yolk sac in the early weeks of gestation and by the gastrointestinal tract and liver later.
It is the most abundant protein in the fetal serum.
It circulates in fetal serum and passes into fetal urine and amniotic fluid.
Concentration of AFP increases steadily in fetal serum till 13 weeks, (3 mg/ml) after which the level rapidly decreases throughout the rest of pregnancy.
AFP level in fetal serum declines following birth and by one year of age, its concentration is 1 ng/ml which persists throughout life.
AFP passes from the fetus to amniotic fluid when fetus passes urine.
It passes into the maternal serum by diffusion across the placental membranes and via placental circulation and is found in steadily increasing quantities in maternal serum after 12 weeks.

These are the usual ways of entry of serum alfa fetoprotein in maternal serum but serum alfa fetoprotein can find its way in maternal serum in other ways too.

Open fetal body wall defects uncoverd by integument permit allows additional AFP to leak into the amniotic fluid and thus maternal serum AFP are increased. This is the reason for increase in serum alpha fetoprotein in neural tube defects and ventral wall defects.
Maternal screening is done between 15-20 weeks (according to Williams 23/e, p 289, Fernando Arias 3/e, p 58).
It is measured in nanograms per ml and reported as a multiple of the median (MOM).
MSAFP of 2.5 MOM is considered as the upper limit of normal (for twin pregnancy it is 3.5 MOM).

Now after having this basic knowledge lets have a look at the question.
In the question alpha fetoprotein will be increased in the following conditions.

Gastroschisis – Ventral wall defect
Omphalocele – Ventral wall defect
Spina bifida occulta – Neural tube defect

In Down’s syndrome - AFP levels are decreased.
Spina bifida occulta:
Spina bifida occulta is usually a small, clinically asymptomatic defect, covered by skin, so there are less chances of mixing of fetal serum and maternal serum. Therefore the maternal serum alphafetoprotein level usually does not increase in spina bifida occulta.
“In the fetus with a defect such as anencephaly or spina bifida, AFP enters the amniotic fluid in increased amounts, leading to higher levels in the maternal serum as well. Levels of AFP are elevated in amniotic fluid and maternal serum only when such lesions are “open,” i.e., when the neural tissue is exposed or covered by only a thin membrane. When NTDs are skin-covered, AFP does not escape from the fetal circulation, and such defects are generally not detected by maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) screening”.
USG in Obs. and Gyane by Callen 4/e, p 25
Omphalocele: 
Fernando Arias 3/e, p 84
It is a midline defect of the anterior abdominal wall characterized by herniation of the abdominal viscera into the base of the umbilical cord.
The protruding organs are typically covered by a thin aminoperitoneal membrane. Omphalocele has a strong association with high levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein because the ventral wall defect allows mixing of fetal and maternal circulation.
Gastroschisis:
Fernando Arias 2/e, p 83
Gastroschisis is a paraumbilical defect of the anterior abdominal wall, through which abdominal viscera herniates. The defect is usually located on the right side of the cord insertion and compromises the full thickness of the abdominal wall. There is no sac or membrane covering the herniated organs. This defect is associated with high alpha feto protein titre.
Both gastroschisis and omphalocele are ventral wall defects containing abdominal organs and both are associated with high alphafetoprotein level in maternal serum.
But it is likely that alphafetoprotein level will be higher in patients with gastroschisis as there is no sac or membrane which covers the herniated organs in this defect. So there is more possibility of fetoprotein leak into the maternal serum or amniotic fluid in Gastroschisis. The answer is further supported by the following graph from

"All are seen with scar dehiscence, except:","Uterine rupture typically is classified as either complete (all layers of the uterine wall separated) or incomplete (uterine muscle separated but visceral peritoneum is intact). Incomplete rupture is commonly referred to as scar dehiscence.
Scar dehiscence is an intraoperative finding always. The greatest risk factor for either complete or incomplete uterine rupture is prior cesarean delivery.
Following uterine rupture the most common electronic fetal monitoring finding is sudden, severe heart rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations, bradycardia, and undetectable fetal heart action.
In some cases in which the fetal presenting part has entered the pelvis with labor, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. If the fetus is partly or totally extruded from the site of uterine rupture, abdominal palpitation or vaginal examination may be helpful to identify the presenting part, which will have moved away from the pelvic inlet.
A firm contracted uterus may at times be felt alongside the fetus. With rupture and expulsion of the fetus into the peritoneal cavity, the chances for intact fetal survival are dismal, and reported morality rates range from 50% to 75%.

The typical presentation of the childhood form includes fever, malaise, and rhinorrhea which is usually followed in 1-7 days by severe pain, especially in the calves. The muscle pain is usually worse with movement and the symptoms last for about a week. Muscle weakness, tenderness, and swelling are usually seen with more severity in adults and the Proximal muscles are affected predominantly.In children, toe walking and wide-based gait may be seen because of the involvement of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles.

"5 years and 4 month old child having small chin, he clinically presents with distal step 2nd molar relation and narrow width of maxilla, having normal SNA angle, decreased SNB angle, with low FMA angle, then. What would be the appropriate treatment protocol for this patient?","When the facial growth pattern is viewed against the perspective of the cephalocaudal gradient, it is not surprising that the mandible, being farther away from the brain, tends to grow more and later than the maxilla, which is closer.
Growth of the mandible continues at a relatively steady rate before puberty. Ramus height increases 1 to 2 mm per year and body length increases 2 to 3 mm per year. These cross-sectional data tend to smooth out the juvenile and pubertal growth spurts, which do occur in growth of the mandible.
Growth in length and height of both jaws continues through the period of puberty.
Since the age of the child is less than 6 years and growth spurts are yet to occur. So at this point of time, in this patient, the best treatment protocol will be wait and watch.

A 32-year-old woman is 9 weeks pregnant and has a 10 year old Down's syndrome child. What test would you recommend for the mother so that she can know about her chances of getting a Down's syndrome baby is this present pregnancy. How will you assure the mother about the chances of Down's syndrome in the present pregnancy?,"Friends – In Patients with previous H/O Down’s syndrome the only confirmatory test, which tells us with 100% reliability of the chances of Down’s syndrome in present pregnancy is “Karyotyping”.
The sample for karyotyping can be obtained in first-trimester by – chorionic villi sampling and in 2nd trimester by amniocentesis.
So obviously we will think of marking option ‘c’ i.e. chorionic villi sampling as the correct answer but, The Question specifically mentions that patient is 9 weeks pregnant and we all know that if CVS is done before 10 weeks– it can lead to limb reduction defects and oromandibular defects in the fetus \Some people argue CVS is not the correct thing to do at this stage.
Read for yourself what Williams has to say on this issue.
“Early reports of an association between CVS and limb. Reduction defects and oromandibular limb hypogenesis caused a great deal of concern (Burton, 1992; Firth, 1991, 1994; Hsieh, 1995, and all their colleagues). Subsequently, it was shown that limb-reduction defects were associated with CVS performed earlier in gestation—typically around 7 weeks”

Amniotic fluid is mainly produced by:,"“The precise origin of the amniotic fluid remains is still not well understood. It is probably of mixed maternal and fetal origin.”
Dutta Obs. 8/e, p 43
But this cannot help us to solve this question.
Let’s see what Williams Obs. has to say on Origin of Amniotic fluid.
“In early pregnancy, amniotic fluid is an ultrafiltrate of maternal plasma. By the beginning of second trimester, it consists largely of extracellular fluid which diffuses through the fetal skin, and thus reflects the composition of fetal plasma”.
After 20 weeks, however, the cornification of fetal skin prevents this diffusion and amniotic fluid is composed largely of fetal urine.”
Williams Obs. 23/e, p 88, 89

A thinner mix of a gypsum-bonded investment will:,"GYPSUM-BONDED INVESTMENTS
The α-hemihydrate form of gypsum is generally the binder for investments used in casting gold-containing alloys with melting ranges below 1000 °C. When this material is heated at temperatures sufficiently high to completely dehydrate the investment and to ensure complete castings, it shrinks considerably and occasionally fractures.
A mixture of silica and calcinated gypsum powder (calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CaSO4• 1/2 H2O) results in setting expansion greater than that of the gypsum product used alone. The silica particles probably interfere with the intermeshing and interlocking of the crystals as they form. Thus, the thrust of the crystals is outward during growth, and they increase expansion.

A patient shows gingival swelling in lower premolar region. Biopsy was taken and histopathological examination showed endothelium-lined vascular spaces and the extreme proliferation of fibroblasts and budding endothelial cells. What could this lesion be:,"Clinically, pyogenic granuloma is a raised lesion on either a sessile or a pedunculated base. Its surface may have a smooth, lobulated, or, occasionally, warty appearance that is erythematous and often ulcerated. Depending on the age of the lesion, the texture varies from soft to firm and is suggestive of an ulcerated fibroma. 
Because of the pronounced vascularity of these lesions, they often bleed easily when probed.
Histologically, the pyogenic granuloma presents as a remarkable proliferation of plump fibroblasts and endothelial cells with the formation of prominent numbers of  thin-walled, endothelium-lined vascular channels. A polymorphous inflammatory cell infiltrate is present, and the overlying surface epithelium is often ulcerated. Treatment consists of surgical excision, with care being taken to completely remove any local irritant that may still be present that would predispose to recurrence of the lesion.

Which of the following toxin is causing this:,Botulinum toxin contains 2 chains- heavy and light. The heavy Chain binds presynaptically to nerve terminals and is responsible for mediating translocation of light chain into the cell. The light chain is active pa which cleaves host protein snap 25 The cleaved snap 25 prevent the release of neurotransmitter Acetylcholine and is responsible flaccid paralysis. The tetanus toxin causes cleavage of synaptobrevin and prevents the release of neurotransmitters GABA and Glycine which causes spastic paralysis.

What should be the best treatment option for the extraction socket shown in  Fig,"OVATE PONTICS

The extraction of a tooth entails removal of the contact point and half the interproximal embrasure; as a consequence, the papilla is not compressed but flattens out, and esthetics  are  compromised.  
The papilla can be maintained if at the time of extraction an ovate  pontic  is created  that  will provide the contact point and lateral embrasure support  that the papilla needs. 
An ovat  pontic is inserted 2.5 mm into the extraction site. The size and shape of the ovate pontic should be the same as the tooth that was extracted.  
A site preservation bone grafting procedure should be performed at the time of the extraction. If the bone levels remain stable, the papilla will also be stable. 

Key Concept
Ovate pontics are used in cases where the residual ridge is defective or incompletely healed.

Which of the following statements regarding Kawasaki disease is true –,"""Coronary artery aneurysm develop in up to 25% of untreated patients"" - Nelson 
Kawasaki disease

Kawasaki disease, also known as lymph node syndrome, mucocutaneous-lymph node syndrome, and infant polyarteritis, is a poorly understood self-limited vasculitis that affects many organs, including the skin mucous membrane, lymph nodes, heart and blood vessel walls.
It is usually seen in children younger than 5 years.
Kawasaki disease predominantly affect medium sized vessels, but may also affect small or large vessels.

Presentation

Presenting features may be divided into : -

1. Mucocutaneous, lymphnode involved

Often begins with high grade fever.


Erythma of mouth, red cracked lips, a strawberry tongue.
Bilateral conjuctival injection with iritis and keratic precipitate.
Red palms and soles
Rash, which may take many forms (but not vesicular), on trunk.
Rash with peeling of skin in genital area perineal desquamation.
Cervical lymphadenopathy
Beau's lines (transverse grooves on nails).


Arthralgia

2. Heart

The cardiac complications are the most important aspect of the disease.
These are due to coronary vasculitis.


Vasculitis causes coronary ectasia and coronary artery aneurism.


Aneurism may lead to MI and sudden death.


Myocarditis, pericarditis with small pericardial effusion.


Valvular regurgitation

A 35 years old lady has chromosomal translocation 21/21. The risk of down syndrome in the child is –,"Cvtogenetic aspects of own's syndrome -

The most common finding is trisomy 21.
Molecular studies have revealed that the additional number 21 chromosome is derived from the mother in 95% of Cases. (The recurrence risk in these families is approximately 1%.)
If a female with Down syndrome due to trisomy 21 conceives then there is a risk of 50% that the baby will also have trisomy 21.
Males with Down syndrome have rarely if ever reproduced.

Chromosome findings in Down syndrome

Trisomy 21, e.g. 47, XY, + 21                  -                  95%
Mosaicism, e.g. 46, XX, / 47, XX, + 21           -         2%
Robertsonian translocation,

e.g. 46 XX, - 15,+ t (15q21q)                           -               3%
Inheritence in Mosaic if own's syndrome

Children with mosaic Down syndrome are usually less severely affected than in the full-blown syndrome, and if only a small proportion of cells are trisomic then these individuals may lead normal lives.
In the event of reproduction, of these individuals there is a relatively high risk that the baby will have full trisomy 21 with the precise risk equalling the proportion of gametes which carry an additional number 21 chromosome.

Inheritance in Down's syndrome with tranclocation

When a child has Down syndrome as a result of an unbalanced Robertsonian translocation, there is a probability of around 25% that one of the parents will carry this in a balanced form. The remaining 75% of cases arise as de novo events and convey a low recurrence risk of approximately 1%
If, however, a parent is shown to be a carrier then there will be a significant risk that a future child will be affected, usually of the order of 2-5% for a carrier male and 10-15% for a carrier female.
In the very rare event that a parent carries a balanced 21q21e Robertsonian translocation, the risk of Down's   drome in liveborn offs rin• will be 100%.

Prothrombin is coagulant factor II. Its formation in liver is dependant on fat soluble vitamin K. Absorption of vitamin K occurs with bile acid. In cholestasis absorption of bile acid (vitamin K) is not affected, rather there is accumulation of bile acids, so levels of vitamin K and clotting factors dependant on vitamin K are also normal. The prothrombin time therefore, remains normal in cholestasis.
Only when ursodeoxycholic acid or cholestyramine are being given to patients of cholestasis.

"Which syndrome consists of flushing, warmness and perspiration over the cheek and pinna of the ear on the side following the ingestion of highly seasoned food?","Auriculotemporal Syndrome (Frey's Syndrome, Gustatory Sweating)
The auriculotemporal syndrome is an unusual phenomenon, which arises as a result of damage to the auriculotemporal nerve and subsequent reinnervation of sweat glands by parasympathetic salivary fibres.
Clinical Features 
The patient typically exhibits flushing and sweating of the involved side of the face, chiefly in the temporal area, during eating. The severity of this sweating may often be increased by tart foods. Of further interest is the fact that profuse sweating may be evoked by the parenteral administration of pilocarpine or eliminated by the administration of atropine or by a procaine block of the auriculotemporal nerve.
There is a form of gustatory sweating which occurs in otherwise normal individuals when they are eating certain foods, particularly spicy or sour ones. This consists of diffuse facial sweating, not simply a perioral sweating and may even be on a hereditary basis.

A person presented to OPD with complaints of rotatory veigo and nausea in the morning on change in position of the head. WHat is your diagnosis?,"Positional veigo/ BPPV: It is characterized by veigo when the head is placed in a ceain critical position. There is no hearing loss or other neurologic symptoms. Positional testing establishes the diagnosis and helps to differentiate it from positional veigo of central origin. Disease caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection. It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals and calcium carbonate, is released from the degeneration macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in a critical head position, it causes displacement of the cupula and veigo. The veigo is fatigable on assuming the same position repeatedly due to dispersal of the otoconia but can be induced again after a period of rest. Thus, typical history and Hallpike maneuver establishes the diagnosis. The condition can be treated by performing Epley's maneuver. The principle of this maneuver is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The doctor stands behind the patient and the assistant on the side. The patient is made to sit on the table so that when he is made to lie down, his head is beyond the edge of the table as is done in Dix-Hallpike maneuver. His face is turned 450 to the affected side. The maneuver consists of five positions * Position 1. With the head turned 450, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix-Hallpike). It will cause veigo and nystagmus. Wait till veigo and nystagmus subside. * Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 900 rotation. * Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 900 -rotation face-down position. * Position 4. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 450. * Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 200. There should be a pause at each position till there is no nystagmus or there is slowing of nystagmus, before changing to the next position. After maneuver is complete, patient should maintain an upright posture for 48 h. Eighty percent of the patients will be cured by a single maneuver. If the patients remain symptomatic, the maneuver can be repeated. A bone vibrator placed on the mastoid bone helps to loosen the debris. - Meniere's disease: Has an episodic veigo and it lasts for >20 minutes. - Vestibular neuronitis: Veigo lasts for many days. - Labyrinthitis: There is a history of fever and trauma, and the veigo lasts for days.",2,Labyrinthitis,BPPV,Vestibular neuronitis,Meniere's disease,ENT,AIIMS 2018,8616b528-3a38-4bc5-b002-2e5133f56496,single,BPPV,BPPV,1.0000003576278689,0.6644598245620728,1.0000003576278689,0.6506558656692505,0.6066008806228638,2

Portion of tooth covered by calculus or altered cementum is:,"Calculus is removed by a series of controlled, overlapping, short, powerful strokes primarily using wrist-arm motion . As calculus is removed, resistance to  the  passage  of  the  cutting  edge  diminishes  until  only  a  slight roughness  remains. Longer, lighter  root-planing  strokes  are  then activated with less lateral pressure until the root surface is completely smooth and hard. The instrument handle must be rolled carefully between the thumb and fingers to keep the blade adapted closely to the tooth surface as line angles, developmental depressions, and other changes in tooth contour are followed. Scaling and root-planing strokes should be confined to the portion of the tooth where calculus or altered cementum is found; this area is known as the instrumentation zone. Sweeping the instrument over the crown where it is not needed wastes operating time, dulls the instrument, and causes loss  of control.

"Which of the following type of flow occurs, when on applying critical shear stress, a material turns to liquid?","The viscosity of many dental materials decreases with increasing strain rate until it reaches a nearly constant value. That is, the faster they are stirred, forced through a syringe, or squeezed, the less viscous and more fluid they become. This is pseudoplastic viscosity and is illustrated by the change in slope of the plot in the figure.
The viscosity of a pseudoplastic fluid decreases with increasing shear rate. 
The tomato-based food condiment ketchup is also pseudoplastic, which makes it difficult to remove from a bottle. Shaking the bottle or rapping the side of the bottle increases its shear rate, decreases its viscosity, and improves its pourability.

Golgi tendon organ  is  situated  in  the  tendon  of skeletal  muscle near the attachment of extrafusal fibers. It is placed in series between the muscle fibers and the  tendon. Golgi tendon organ is formed by a group of nerve endings covered by a connective tissue capsule.
NERVE SUPPLY TO GOLGI TENDON ORGAN
Sensory nerve fiber supplying the Golgi tendon organ belongs to Ib type. The nerve fiber supplying Golgi tendon organ ramifies into many branches. Each branch ends in the form of a knob. 
FUNCTIONS OF GOLGI TENDON ORGAN

A 28 year old eclamptic woman develop convulsions.The first measure to be done is:,"Preeclampsia when complicated with convulsion and / or coma is called eclampsia.
Fits occurring in eclampsia are Generalised tonic clonic seizure.
In most cases seizures are self limited, lasting for 1 to 2 minutes.
Management:
“The first priorities are to ensure that the airway is clear and to prevent injury and aspiration of gastric content
COGDT 10/e, p 326
Initial management during eclamptic fit:

Patients should be kept in an isolated room to protect from noxious stimulus which might provoke further fits.
Mouth gag is placed between teeth to prevent tongue bite.
Air passage is cleared off the mucus.
Oxygen is given.
Catheterization is done to monitor urine output.

Specific management:
A. Medical management
i. Seizure treatment

The drug of choice for the control and prevention of convulsions is magnesium sulphate (Pritchard’s regimen) Previously used anticonvulsant regimen for eclampsia was ‘Lytic cocktail regimen’ given by Menon using pethidine, chlorpromazine and phenargen. but now it is not used.

ii. Treatment of hypertension

DOC in eclampsia is labetalol.
2nd DOC in eclampsia is hydralazine.

B. Obstetric management in antepartum cases:

Immediate termination of pregnancy should be done.
Vaginal delivery is preferred but “In current obstetrical practice the large majority of eclamptic women are delivered by cesarean section. The most common exception to cesarean delivery are women with a fetal demise and the rare ones with a very ripe cervix.”

Psoas abscesses may arise from a hematogenous source, by contiguous spread from an intra- abdominal or pelvic process, or by contiguous spread from nearby bony structures (e.g., veebral bodies). Associated osteomyelitis due to spread from bone to muscle or from muscle to bone is common in psoas abscesses. When pott's disease was common, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was a frequent cause of psoas abscess. Currently, either S. aureus or a mixture of enteric organisms including aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli is usually isolated from psoas abscesses in the United States. S. aureus is most likely to be isolated when a psoas abscess arises from hematogenous spread or a contiguous focus of osteomyelitis; a mixed enteric flora is the most likely etiology when the abscess has an intra- abdominal or pelvic source. Patients with psoas abscesses frequently present with fever, lower abdominal or back pain, or pain referred to the hip or knee. CT is the most useful diagnostic technique.""- Harrison 19/e p852 ""Spinal TB (Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis) often involves two or more adjacent veebral bodies. Whereas the upper thoracic spine is the most common site of spinal TB in children, the lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are usually affected in adults. From the anterior superior or inferior angle of the veebral body, the lesion slowly reaches the adjacent body, later affecting the interveebral disk. With advanced disease, collapse of veebral bodies results in kyphosis (gibbus). A paraveebral ""cold"" abscess may also form. In the upper spine, this abscess may track to and penetrate the chest wall, presenting as a soft tissue mass; in the lower spine, it may reach the inguinal ligaments or present as a psoas abscess.

Example of Dystrophic calcification-,"Answer- D. Myositis ossificansMyositis Ossificans (MO) is an unusual pathological entity still largely unknown, characterized by dystrophic calcification leading to heterotopic ossification of intramuscular connective tissue.DYSTROPHIC CALCIFICATION may occur due to 2 types of causes:Calcification in dead tissueCalcification of degenerated tissue.Calcification in dead tissue:Caseous necrosis in tuberculosisLiquefaction necrosis in chronic abscessesFat necrosis following acute pancreatitis or traumatic fatnecrosis in the breast results in the deposition of calcium soaps.Gamma-Gandy bodies in chronic venous congestion (CVC) of the spleen is characterized by calcific deposits admixed with haemosiderin on fibrous tissue.Infarcts may sometimes undergo dystrophic calcification.Thrombi, especially in the veins, may produce phleboliths.Haematomas in the vicinity of bones may undergo dystrophic calcification.Dead parasites like in hydatid cyst, Schistosoma eggs, and cysticercosis are some of the examples showing dystrophic calcification.Calcification in breast cancer detected by mammography.Congenital toxoplasmosis involving the central nervous system visualized by calcification in the infant's brain.Calcification in degenerated tissues1. Dense old scars may undergo hyaline degeneration and subsequent calcification.2. Atheromas in the aoa and coronaries frequently undergo calcification.3. Mo?nckeberg's sclerosis shows calcification in the tunica media of muscular aeries in elderly people.4. The stroma of tumors such as uterine fibroids, breast cancer, thyroid adenoma, goiter, etc shows calcification.5. Some tumors show characteristic spherules of calcification called psammoma bodies or calcospherites such as in meningioma, papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.6.

"Model plaster (white) used to cast study models before mixing with water, is largely composed of:","When plaster is mixed with water, it takes up one and a half molecules of water, i.e, it regains its water of crystallization and becomes calcium sulphate dihydrate.
(CaSO4)2.H2O + 3H2O → 2CaSO4.2H2O+ unreacted (CaSO4)2.½H2O + Heat
Hemihydrate + Water → Dihydrate + Unreacted hemihydrate + Heat
The reaction is exothermic and is the same for all gypsum products. The amount of water required to produce a workable mix varies between the products. As evident from the above reaction, not all of the hemihydrate converts to dihydrate. The amount of conversion is dependent on the type of stone. The highest conversion rate is seen in plaster (90%). In Type 4 and 5 stone, the dihydrate content is about 50%. 
Key Concept
This corresponds to the first step in the reaction. The principal constituent of gypsum-based products is calcium sulfate hemihydrate .

reastfeeding jaundice and Breastmilk jaundice 

There is strong association between exclusive breastfeeding and neonatal jaundice.
A few babies who remain on exclusive breast feed develop jaundice in the second week of life and continue well into the third month. This is called breastmilk jaundice.
A bilirubin level of over 20 mg/dl may be attained. (It is presumed to be due to inhibitory substances in the breastmilk that interfere with bilirubin conjugation e.g. pregananediol and free fatty acids).
Temporary interruption of breastmilk feeds will dramatically reduce the serum levels of bilirubin and there may be slight increase in bilirubin when breast feeding is resumed, but it never reaches the previous levels. Hypothyroidism  
Persistent elevation of indirect bilirubin is the first sign of congenital hypothyroidism in neonates.
This is due to decreased activity of UDPGT for weeks or months after birth.
At least 10% of all infants with congenital hypothyroidism will have jaundice as the presenting symptom.
Treatment with thyroxine promptly alleviates jaundice.

Particle size : Finer particles react more quickly as a greater surface area is exposed to ​the liquid.​
Water content of liquid : Presence of excess water accelerates, whereas insufficient water ​retards the reaction.​
Buffering agents : When added, slow down the reaction.​

​Factors under control of operator​

Temperature : Higher temperature accelerates the reaction. Cooling the mixing slab is an effective way of slowing the reaction and prolonging the working time.​
Powder-liquid ratio : More the liquid, slower the reaction. ​
Rate of addition of powder to liquid : The reaction is slower, if the powder is incorporated slowly.​
Mixing time : The longer the mixing time (within practical limits), the slower is the rate of reaction.

Hydrocephalus is best detected antenately by:,"Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is an abnormal increase in cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricular and subarachnoid spaces of brain.
“The prenatal diagnosis of hydrocephalus is usually made by demonstration of a dilated ventricular system in an ultrasound examination.”
Fernando Arias 2/e, p 331

Earliest and most accurate sonographic sign of hydrocephalus – Enlarged lateral ventricles.
The lateral ventricle is measured at the level of atrium.
Normal transverse diameter of atrium is 7 mm + 1 mm (It remains constant during the second and third trimester).
When diameter of atrium is >10 mm, it is called as Ventriculomegaly/Hydrocephalus.

Chronic mercury toxicity results from:,"All the options given in the question lead to mercury toxicity.
Methyl mercury is the most common form that is transformed by natural processes; it is a more toxic form than ethyl mercury (C2H5Hg+) or elemental mercury. Methyl mercury is a major safety concern because it bioaccumulates through the food chain; its pharmacokinetic half-life is longer (1.5 to 3 months) than that of ethyl mercury (less than 1 week). In air, the concentrations of mercury range from about 0.01 to 0.02 µg/m3.
Mercury accumulates in the kidneys. In the brain, metallic mercury can be converted to an inorganic form that is retained in the brain. Elemental mercury and mercury vapor have a half-life of 1 to 3 months. Mercury leaves the body by excretion through urine and feces.
Exposure to high levels of mercury can injure the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Chronic mercury toxicity may be manifested as tremors; memory loss; and changes in personality, vision, and hearing.

Which of the following is the least important prognostic factor in congenital diaphragmatic hernia ?,"Timing of surgical repair has gradually shifted from an emergency repair, to a policy of stabilization using a variety of ventilatory strategies prior to operation. •
Current recommendation is to adopt a conservative approach and delay surgical repair of the CDH until the infant stablizes from a hemodynamic and respiratory point of view.

Prognostic factors in CDI-1 

Prognostic factors can be divided into:

(A) Primary prognostic factors (Pathophysiological)

These are the most important prognostic factor which affect morbidity and mortility.
These factors are:


Pulmonary hypoplasia (most important)
Pulmonary hypertension (2nd most important)

(B) Secondary or relative predictors (diagnostic/clinical)

These poor prognostic factors are:

(a)      tinatal

Detection at an early gestational age (<24 wks)
Associated extradiaphragmatic congenital anomalies
Liver herniation into thorax (Liver above diaphragm)


Stomach herniationinto thorax (Stomach above diaphragm)

"In Ricketts esthetic plane, lower lip rests:","Ricketts’ E line:
R. M. Ricketts suggested using an esthetic (E) plane to evaluate the relationship between the nose, lips and chin. Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. A quick method to look at one profile is to imagine a line tangent from the lower chin to the nose tip. Cephalometrically, Ricketts’ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the nose–chin line as a reference point. These values are for Caucasians and clearly cannot be applied to all races.

Flow of a material refers to:,"The term flow, rather than creep, has generally been used in dentistry to describe the rheology of amorphous materials.
Creep is defined as the time-dependent plastic strain of a material under a static load or constant stress.
The creep or flow is measured as the percentage decrease in length that occurs under these testing conditions.
Key Concept: Flow of a material refers to continued change of the material under a given load.

"Cephalosporins have all of the following interactions & uses, except:","CEPHALOSPORINS 

These are a group of semisynthetic antibiotics derived from 'cephalosporin-C obtained from a fungus Cephalosporium. They are chemically related to penicillins; the nucleus consists of a beta-lactam ring fused to a dihydrothiazine ring, (7-aminocepha losporanic acid). By addition of different side chains at position 7 of beta-lactam ring (altering spectrum of activity) and at position 3 of dihydrothiazine ring (affecting pharmacokinetics), a large number of semisynthetic compounds have been produced. 

Some salient features are:

These are not penicillinase resistance (just like penicillins).
Attributed to the similar chemical structure to penicillins they show cross sensitivity with penicillins.
These are broadspectrum antibiotics but are inactive against anaerobes.
These can be used effectively in upper respiratory tract infection.

Rheumatic fever (RF) is an acute, immunologically mediated, multisystem inflammatory disease classically occurring a few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis; occasionally, RF can follow streptococcal infections at other sites, such as the skin. Acute rheumatic carditis is a common manifestation of active RF and may progress over time to chronic rheumatic hea disease (RHD), mainly manifesting as valvular abnormalities. RHD is characterized principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, paicularly involving the mitral valve; indeed, RHD is viually the only cause of mitral stenosis Type of necrosis seen in RHD - Fibrinoid necrosis. Morphology: Distinctive lesions occur in the hea, called Aschoff bodies, consisting of foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cell (pathognomonic fo RF).These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei (occasionally binucleate) in which the chromatin condenses into a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation ""caterpillar cells"").",4,Sarcoidosis,Fungal granuloma,Tuberculosis,Rheumatic hea disease,Pathology,AIIMS 2017,f7c04393-b875-4566-9342-0dba89656d27,single,Rheumatic hea disease,Rheumatic hea disease,0.9999998211860656,0.7080821394920349,0.719976544380188,0.695817768573761,0.9999998211860656,4

Which inflammatory mediator involve in intracellular killing of microbes?,"The killing of microbes and the destruction of ingested materials are accomplished by reactive oxygen species (ROS, also called reactive oxygen intermediates), reactive nitrogen species, mainly derived from nitric oxide (NO), and lysosomal enzymes.
Neutrophils and monocytes contain granules packed with enzymes and anti-microbial proteins that degrade microbes and dead tissues and may contribute to tissue damage. These granules are actively secretory and thus distinct from classical lysosomes. 
Neutrophils have two main types of granules:

The smaller specific (or secondary) granules contain lysozyme, collagenase, gelatinase, lactoferrin, plasminogen activator, histaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. 
The larger azurophil (or primary) granules contain MPO, bactericidal factors (such as defensins), acid hydrolases, and a variety of neutral proteases (elastase, cathepsin G, nonspecific collagenases, proteinase 3).

Sign and symptoms of Brain tumors in children

Children with brain tumors frequently have symptoms and signs that strongly suggest the appropriate diagnosis.
The clinical triad of symptoms associated with increased ICT -4 headache, vomiting, blurred vision / diplopia, is the hallmark of brain tumors in childhood.
These symptoms occur more frequently with mid-line posterior fossa (infratentorial) tumors owing to the propensity of lesions close to the ventricular CSF flow system.
Symptoms of the brain tumors vary depending upon which part of the brain the tumor is found :­

Brain tumor in cerebrum (supratentorial)

Seizures                                 o Hemiperes is or Hemiplegia          o Drowsiness / confusion
Visual changes                     o T ICT (less common)                        o Personality changes

Brain tumor in brain stem

Seizures                                 o Diplopia             o Respiratory changes o T ICT (Rare)
Endocrine problem (DM) o Headache            o Cranial N. palsy

Brain tumor in cerebellum

T ECT (most common)     o Headache          o Uncoordinated movement
Vomiting                               o Ataxia

Symptoms due to raised ICT --> These are mainly caused by midline posterior fossa tumor --> Medulloblastoma.

Headache                                                    o Nausea                                                  o Drowsiness
Vomiting (usually in the morning)         o Personality changes                         o Papilledema
Diplopia / blurred vision                           o Irritability

The logical explanation for the unique anticariogenic property of most silicate cements is:,"The incidence of secondary caries is markedly less around silicate restorations. This is surprising when considering that severe leakage takes place at its margins. 
Also, the incidence of contact caries is less when compared to amalgam restorations (contact caries is the term applied to caries occurring on the proximal surface of the tooth adjacent to the restoration). 
The anti-cariogenic property is due to presence of 15% fluoride. Fluoride release is slow and occurs throughout the life of the restoration. Silicate cement was classed as a severe irritant to the pulp because of its low pH (acidic). 
For many years, silicate served as a standard for comparing the pulpal response to other materials. In deep cavities, the pulp had to be protected with varnish or calcium hydroxide.

All of the following about Vitamin D metabolism are true except,"In Williams syndrome there is failure to gain weight (not obesity) and delay in development (not-precocious puberty)

Williams syndrome

Williams syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by:


Unusual facial features: Elfin facial appearance, widely spaced teeth, a long philthrum along with a low nasal bridge, an unusually cheerful demeanor and ease with strangers.
Heart defects: Supravalvular aortic stenosis.
Development delay: Mental retardation, failure to gain weight (failure to thrive), low muscle tone.
Transient hypercalcemia


Other features include GI problems (Colic, abdominal pain, diverticulitis), nocturnal enuresis, dental irregularities, hypothyroidism, hyperacussis and photophobia.

Vitamin D 

It occurs mainly in two forms


Vit D3 —> Cholecalciferol - synthesized in skin under the influence of UV rays from 7-dehydrocholesterol.
Vit D2 —) Calciferol - present in irradiatiate food-yeast, fungi, bread.

A woman comes with postdated pregnancy at 42 weeks. The initial evaluation would be:,"A pregnancy continuing beyond two weeks of the expected date of delivery (> 42 weeks or >294 days) is called postmaturity or post-term pregnancy. Pregnancy between 41-42 weeks is called prolonged pregnancy.
Most common cause of post term pregnancy is wrong dates so, a careful review of menstrual history is important in all
such cases –
“If the patient is sure about her date with previous history of regular cycles, it is a fairly reliable diagnostic aid in the calculation of the period of gestation. But in cases of mistaken maturity or pregnancy occurring during lactational amenorrhoea or soon following withdrawal of the pill’, confusion arises. In such cases, the previous well documented antenatal records of first visit in first trimester if available, are useful guides.”
Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 319

In heart patient the worst prognosis during pregnancy is seen in:,"Remember 3 ‘FUNDAS: Highest maternal mortality is associated with Class III of clarkes cl;assification, so any of those diseases are given they will have the worst prognosis. Amongst them also Eisenmengers syndrome has the worst prognosis.
↓
2. Stenotic heart disease have a worse prognosis than regurgitant lesions.
Among stenotic disease-(in alphabetical order)-Aortic stenosiswill have the worst> Mitral stenosis>Pulmonary stenosis.
↓
3. Congenital heart disease and Mitral valve prolapse have the best prognosis
So now this question becomes very easy-Mitarl vave prolapse has the best prognosis, so it is ruled out; Regurgitant lesions have a better prognosis than stenotic lesions so mitral regurgitation is also ruled out. Now we are left with 2 options, aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis-as I said go alphabetically, aortic stenosis will have a worse prognosis than pulmonary.
Let’s consider each of the options one by one and see what Williams has to say about each of them.
Option “a” Mitral regurgitation
“M R is well-tolerated during pregnancy probably due to decreased systemic vascular resistance which actually results in less regurgitation. Heart failure only rarely develops during pregnany.”
Williams Obs. 22/e, p 1026, 23/e, p 966
Option “b” Mitral valve prolapse
“Pregnant women with mitral valve prolapse rarely have cardiac complications. In fact pregnancy induced hypervolemia may improve alignment of mitral valve.”
Williams Obs. 22/e, p 1030, 23/e, p 971
Option “c” Aortic stenosis
“Although mild to moderate degree of aortic stenosis is well tolerated but severe degree is life threatening.”
Williams Obs. 22/e, p 1026, 23/e, p 967
Option “d” Pulmonary stenosis
“It is well tolerated during pregnancy and rarely causes any complication.”

True about congenital diseases in diabetes mellitus is all except:,"Lets see each option separately -
Congenital disease in diabetes mellitus
Option a i.e. Results due to free radical injury - True -
Congenital malformation in a case of diabetes can be due to variety of reasons like, Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 287

Genetic susceptibility
Hyperglycemia - It is seen that good glycemic control indicated by HbAIC levels < %.9 can significantly lower the risk of fetal malformation.
Arachidonic acid deficiency
Ketone body formation
Free Radical injury
Somatomedin inhibition.

Option b–6 to 10% cases are associated with major congenital abnormality
Here we will have to read the option very carefully - the option is talking about Major congenital anomalities and not all anomalies.
Dutta Obs 6/e, p- 287 says overall incidence of congenital Malformations is 6-10%.
Williams 24/e p 1128. “The incidence of major malformations in women with type I diabetes is ~ 5%”
Hence option b is incorrect
Option c - 1 - 2% of newborns are associated with single umbilical artery
This option can be taken in + /– status because no where the incidence of single umbilical artery in a case of diabetes has been mentioned separately.
Whatever little information we have is from Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 220
Single umbilical artery:

It is present in 1-2% cases (overall)
May be due to failure of development of artery or due to its atrophy in later months
It is seen in case of

i. Twins
ii. Babies born to diabetic mothers
iii. In polyhydramines

Single umbilical artery has been associated with congenital malformations of the fetus in 10-20% cases viz- Renal & Genital anomalies and fetal Trisomy
There is increased incidence of abortions, prematurity, IUGR and increased perinatal mortality.

Option d- insulin can be given
There is no doubt as far as this option is concerned as insulin is the TOC for controlling hyperglycemia in case of diabetes in pregnancy.
So from above discussion it is clear that option ‘b’ is absolutely incorrect, so we are opting it out.",2,Results due to free radical injury,6-10% cases are associated with major congenital abnormality,1-2% of newborns are associated with single umbilical artery,Insulin can be given,Gynaecology & Obstetrics,,3f5b3234-71dc-4d1e-a1fe-265407c17c5a,multi,6-10% cases are associated with major congenital abnormality,Results due to free radical injury,0.6903943419456482,1.0000001192092896,0.6903943419456482,0.6725776195526123,0.6947963237762451,1

Hepcidin decreases iron absorption by inhibition of -,"Ans - b). FerropoinIron leaves the mucosal cell a transpo protein ferropoin, but only if there is free transferrin in plasma to bind to. Once transferrin is saturated with iron, any that has accumulated in the mucosal cells is lost when the cells are shed. Expression of the ferropoin gene is downregulated by hepcidin, a peptide secreted by the liver when body iron reserves are adequate. In response to hypoxia, anemia, or hemorrhage, the synthesis of hepcidin is reduced, leading to increased synthesis of ferropoin and increased iron absorption.

Which of the following is not a cross-linking fixative?,"Chemical fixation This utilizes organic or non-organic solutions to maintain adequate morphological preservation. Chemical fixatives can be considered as members of three major categories: coagulant, cross-linking, and compound. Coagulant fixatives: Both organic and non-organic solutions may coagulate proteins making them insoluble. Cellular architecture in vivo is maintained primarily by lipoproteins and fibrous proteins such as collagen. Coagulating these proteins maintains tissue histomorphology at the light microscope level. Unfounately, because coagulant fixatives result in cytoplasmic flocculation and poor preservation of mitochondria and secretory granules, these fixatives are not useful in ultrastructural analysis. Examples: Ethanol, methanol, acetone, picric acid and trichloroacetic acid Cross-linking fixatives: Several chemicals were selected as fixatives secondary to their potential actions of forming cross-links both within and between proteins and nucleic acids. Examples include formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and other aldehydes, e.g. chloral hydrate and glyoxal, as well as metal salts, e.g. mercuric and zinc chloride, and other metallic compounds, e.g. osmium tetroxide. useful for electron microscopic examination - Glutraldehyde (best one)/formaldehyde/osmium tetraoxide Compound fixatives: Alcoholic formalin",3,Osmium tetroxide,Glutaraldehyde,Methanol,Formaldehyde,Pathology,AIIMS 2020,139d03ab-9bd0-4bb7-a076-8b3b2ff2528e,single,Methanol,Methanol,0.9999999403953552,0.7332057356834412,0.7567092180252075,0.9999999403953552,0.7842194437980652,3

"A newborn with eyes closed 6 hrs after birth lustily crying, no chest retraction and movements of all four limbs. Neonatal behavioral response grading –","Neonatal behavioral assessment scale

Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale (NBAS) is used to support parents in the neonatal unit, especially around discharge home. The aim is to increase parents' confidence in understanding their baby.
An infant's reaction are state related. So it is extremely important that observations of state be considered as a starting point from which all other observations are made.
The ideal time to administer the examination is when the infant is asleep and midway between feeding cycles.

Scores 
Sleep states

State 1 : Sleep with regular breathing, eyes closed, no spontaneous activity except startles or jerky movements at quite regular intervals.

a State 2 : Sleep with eyes closed; rapid eye movements can often be observed under closed lids; low activity level with random movements and startles.
Awake states

State 3 : Drowsy or semidrowsy; eyes may be open but dull and heavy lidded, or closed, eyelids fluttering; activity level minimal, Movements are usually smooth, although there may be startles. Some infants may also show fuss/cry vocalizations in this state. What distinguishes state 3 from state 5 when both are accompanied by fuss/cry vocalizations is the minimal movement in state 3 and considerable movement in state 5.
State 4 : Alert, eyes open with bright look. Motor activity is minimal; there can be a glazed look that is easily changed into a brighter look with appropriate stimulation.


State 5 : Eyes likely to be open; considerable motor activity, with thrusting movements of the extremities, and even a few spontaneous startles; reactive to external stimulation with increase in startles or motor activity.


State 6 : Crying : characterized by intense, loud, rhythmic, and sustained cry vocalizations that are difficult to break through with stimulation; motor activity is high.

Coming to the question

According to above staging, the newborn in our question comes under state 6 (crying lustily, and moving all 4 limbs).
If you have any confusion, read the following facts on crying (state 6) :-

""it is important to distinguish between crying as a state (stage 6) from the fuss/ay vocalization that can occur in state 5 and even state 3. Some infants show repeated episodes of fuss /cry vocalization in state 5 but may not reach state 6. This may also be a maturational issue, because some preterm infants may not have energy reserves to sustain state 6. In general, state 6 Can be distinguished from state 5 by the intensity and sustained quality of the crying (at least 15 seconds) and unavailability of infant in state 6. Repeated brief episodes of cry /fuss in state 5 do not mean that the infant has moved into state 6. Examiners need to give the infant the opportunity to show state 6""

Nobel prize for medicine/physiology in 2018 for the discovery of:,"Ans. C. Negative immune regulationNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly, has been awarded to James P. Allison/Tasuku Honjo for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.James P. Allison studied a known protein that functions as a brake on the immune system. He realized the potential of releasing the brake and thereby unleashing our immune cells to attack tumors.Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints are negative regulators of T-cell immune function. Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers.For several types of cancer, including lung cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma and melanoma checkpoint therapy against PD-1 has proven more effective and positive results found.But recent clinical studies indicate that for melanoma the combination therapy of both CTLA-4 and PD-1 is more effective.Thus, Allison and Honjo combine different strategies to release the brakes on the immune system with the aim of eliminating tumor cells even more efficiently.Their paper formed the basis of current cancer immunotherapy.But the original concept of cancer immunotherapy was discovered by William Bradley Coley (1872).",3,Apoptotic pathway,Crispr-Cas9,Negative immune regulation,Molecular mechanisms controlling circadian rhythm,Medicine,,9ba605e2-bf6d-427b-a4ed-c8948569ac22,single,Negative immune regulation,Negative immune regulation,1.000000238418579,0.7327091097831726,0.6807212829589844,1.000000238418579,0.773160457611084,3

Not a part of ethmoid bone is,"The ethmoid bone is cuboidal in overall shape and contains the ethmoidal cells (ethmoidal sinuses). It is composed of

Two rectangular box-shaped ethmoidal labyrinths, one on each side.
They are united superiorly across the midline by a perforated sheet of bone - the cribriform plate. 
The perpendicular plate - A second sheet of bone descends vertically in the median sagittal plane from the cribriform plate to form part of the nasal septum.

Ethmoidal labyrinth:
Each ethmoidal labyrinth is composed of two delicate sheets of bone, which sandwich between them the ethmoidal cells.
■ The lateral sheet of bone (the orbital plate) is flat and forms part of the medial wall of the orbit.
■ The medial sheet of bone forms the upper part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and is characterized by two processes and a swelling—

The two processes are curved shelves of bone (the superior and middle conchae), which project across the nasal cavity and curve downward ending in free medial margins, while inferior to the origin of the middle concha, the middle ethmoidal cells form a prominent bulge (the ethmoidal bulla), on the medial wall of the labyrinth.
Agger nasi - runs forward and downwards from upper end of anterior border of middle concha.

TO NOTE: Inferior concha/ inferior nasal turbinate is an independant bone, not a projection of ethmoidal labyrinth.
Ethmoidal infundibulum:- Extending anterosuperiorly from just under the bulla is a groove (the ethmoidal infundibulum), which continues upward, and narrows to form a channel that penetrates the ethmoidal labyrinth and opens into the frontal sinus. This channel is for the frontonasal duct, which drains the frontal sinus.
Uncinate process:- A delicate irregularly shaped projection (the uncinate process) on the anterior aspect of the inferior surface of the ethmoidal labyrinth.
Cribriform plate:

The cribriform plate is at the apex of the nasal cavities and fills the ethmoidal notch in the frontal bone and separates the nasal cavities below from the cranial cavity above.
Small perforations in the bone allow the fibers of the olfactory nerve  to pass between the two regions.
A large triangular process (the crista galli) at the midline on the superior surface of the cribriform plate anchors a fold (falx cerebri) of dura mater in the cranial cavity.

Perpendicular plate of ethmoid:

The perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone is quadrangular in shape, descends in the midline from the cribriform plate, and forms the upper part of the median nasal septum.",1,Inferior turbinate,Agar nasi cells,Uncinate process,Crista galli,Anatomy,,ad0f4284-cf88-4196-89d4-75c75cdae0f9,multi,Inferior turbinate,Inferior turbinate,1.0000001192092896,1.0000001192092896,0.6857542395591736,0.7303217649459839,0.681350588798523,1

INH is extensively metabolized in liver; most impoant pathway being N-acetylation by NAT2. The acetylated metabolite is excreted in urine. The rate of INH acetylation shows genetic variation. There are either: Fast acetylators: (30-40% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 1 hr. Slow acetylators: (60-70% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 3 hr. Slow acetylators will not be able to metabolize the drug quickly and there will be accumulation of isoniazid.

Low serum iron with increased iron binding capacity results in a reduction of transferrin saturation to below 15%. Reduced iron stores inhibit hepcidin synthesis, and its serum levels fall. In uncomplicated iron deficiency, oral iron supplementation produces an increase in reticulocytes in about 5 to 7 days that is followed by a steady increase in blood counts and the normalization of red cell indices Earliest parameter to be affected in the Iron deficiency anemia patient - Serum ferritin.

"Unconjugated bilirubin is increased in all, except –","Dubin Jhonson syndrome is a cause of congenital conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Congenital conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
1)Dubin Jhonson syndrome 

DJS is a type of congenital conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
It is autosomal recessive.
Conjugated bilirubin is increased because of defective biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides due to mutation in canalicular multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP 2).
Liver function tests are normal
A cardinal feature of DJS is the accumulation in the lysosome of centrilobular hepatocytes of dark, coarsely granular pigment. As a result, the liver is black in appearance. This pigment is thought to be derived from epinephrine metabolites that are not excreted normally.
There is increased urinary excretion of coproporphyrine I (normal coproporphyrine III is more excreted), but total coproporphyrine level is normal.
Gall bladder is not visualized on oral cholecystography.
After iv administration, there is reflux of conjugated sulfobromophthalein (Bromsulphalein, BSP) from liver to circulation.

2)Rotor syndrome

Rotor syndrome is a type of congenital conjugated hyperbilimbinemia.
It is autosomal recessive.
It is due to decreased biliary excretion of conjugated bilirubin and also due to decrease hepatic uptake & storage of bilirubin.
Differentiating features of rotor syndrome (from DJS) -


Liver is not pigment
Coproporphyrine I is increased in urine but total coproporphyrine level is also increased.

“Apexification is defined as chemically induced root formation by calcium hydroxide or CMCP in nonvital immature, blunderbuss canals of young permanent teeth.”
APEXIFICATION 
It is a method of inducing apical closure by formation of mineralized tissue in the apical region of a nonvital permanent tooth with an incompletely formed root apex. 
It is defined as a method to induce development of the root apex of an immature pulpless tooth by formation of osteocementum/bone-like tissue (Cohen).

Which of the following show chemical bond with enamel (calcified tissues)?,"When the powder and liquid are mixed, the surface of powder particles are attacked by the acid, releasing zinc, magnesium and tin ions. These ions bind to the polymer chain via the carboxyl groups. They also react with carboxyl groups of adjacent polyacid chains to form cross-linked salts. Structure of set cement the hardened cement consists of an amorphous gel matrix of zinc polyacrylate in which unreacted powder particles are dispersed.
Key concept:-
Zinc polycarboxylate cement was the first dental cement to exhibit chemical bonding to teeth, marking an improvement over the mechanical bonding of zinc phosphate cement. Zinc polycarboxylate cement is not used for restorative purposes because the cement is opaque.

"An 8–day old breast–fed baby presents with vomiting, poor feeding and loose stools. On examination the heart rate is 190/minute, blood pressure 50/30 mmHg, respiratory rate 72 breaths/minute and capillary refill time of 4 seconds. Investigations show hemoglobin level of 15 g/dl. Na 120 mEq/l, K 6.8 mEq/l, Cl 81 meq/l, bicarbonate 15 mEq/l, urea 30 mg/dl and creatinine 0.6 mg/dl. the most likely diagnosis is –","Both the serum creatinine and serum urea are abnormal in this neonate. They may be normal for an adult, but for an 8 day old infant they are elevated.
First the serum creatinine level
 
The serum creatinine level is high at birth reflecting the maternal value but it falls rapidly to 0.4 mg/dl by the end of the first week.
According to Nelson, creatinine level in various age groups are
Cord blood     ______ >      0.6 —1.2 mg/di
New born _______ >       0.3 — 1.0 mg/dl
Infant       ______ >                           0.2 - 0.4 mg/di
Child       ______ >                           0.3 - 0.7 mg/di
Adolescent ______ >       0.5 — 1.0 mg/di
Do not get confused by the creatinine level of the newborn i.e., 0.3 — 1.0 mg/dl.
This high level reflects the maternal value and it comes down to 0.2 to 0.4 mg/dl by 5th day
So, Creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dl is abnormally high in an 8 day old infant.
Now, the serum urea level
The serum urea level in cord blood is 21-40 mg/dl, but it falls rapidly to 3-12 mg/dl by the 4th or 5th day.
So urea level of 30 mg/dl is abnormally high in an 8 day old infant.
According to Nelson Serum urea level in various age group
Cord blood   ______ >                     21-40 ing/dl
Premature      ______ >                    3-25 mg/dl
Newborn   ______ >                         3-12 mg/dl
Infant/child _____ >       5-18 ing/d1
Now, the capillary refill time
Capillary refill time is also prolonged here (N ---> < 3 seconds)
Prolonged capillary refill time indicates loss offluid and indicates shock, heart failure, Sympathetic stimulation
In acute renal failure due to fluid loss cappillary refill time is increased
All these findings plus characteristic h/o vomiting, poor feeding and loose stools confirms the diagnosis of acute renal failure (acute tubular necrosis)
Electrolyte abnormalities in ARF --->             1) Hyponatremia,        2) Hyperkalemia,       3) Loss of Bicarbonate

Which of the following is the most appropriate method for obtaining a urine specimen for culture in an 8 month old girl –,"Diagnosis of urinary tract infection

A UTI may be suspected based on the symptoms or finding on urinalysis or both, but a urine culture is necessary for confirmation and appropriate therapy.
Thus the diagnosis of UTI depends on having the proper sample of urine.
There are several ways to obtain a urine sample, some are more accurate than others.
These methods are —


Midstream urine sample —

It is satisfactory in toilet trained children and in circumcised boys. But in young infants and boys who cannot ratract their foreskin, it is not reliable. Such samples will usually reflect periurethral and prepucial organisms and cells.

Collection in an adhesive sealed sterile collection bag after disinfection of the genitals


Is a useful technique in infants, but potential contamination from genitals and perianal area can occur.

3. Urine specimen through catheterization or indwelling catheter —

Urine specimen through a catheter is less likely to be contaminated than the voided specimens as described above. It is also less invasive than suprapubic aspiration, but it is not as sensitive as suprapubic aspiration.


A catherized specimen is reliable if the first portion of the urine that may contain urethral organisms is discarded and specimen is taken from later flow through the catheter, but it has the disadvantage of being traumatic and of potentially introducing urethral organisms into sterile bladder


Suprapubic aspiration -
Suprapubic aspiration is best method to collect urine specimen for culture.
It is the most reliable method
It can be performed safely in children and in premature infants by 21 or 22 gauge needle.
This procedure avoids any sort of contamination, however it is invasive. So it is used only in infants and selected patients.

Antibiotic that interferes with DNA function is:,"Mechanism of Action

Metronidazole is a prodrug requiring reductive activation of the nitro group by susceptible organisms.
 Unlike their aerobic counterparts, anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens contain electron transport components that have a sufficiently negative redox potential to donate electrons to metronidazole.
 The single-electron transfer forms a highly reactive nitro radical anion that kills susceptible organisms by radical-mediated mechanisms that target DNA.

Which of the following instruments are more efficient?,"Carbon Steel

Carbon steel alloy contains 0.5 to 1.5 percent carbon in iron.
Instruments made from carbon steel are known for their hardness and sharpness.
Disadvantages with these instruments are their susceptibility to corrosion and fracture. They are of two types:

1. Soft steel: It contains <0.5% carbon
2. Hard steel: It contains 0.5 to 1.5% carbon
Stainless Steel

Stainless steel alloy contains 72 to 85 percent iron, 15 to 25 percent chromium and 1 to 2 percent carbon.
Instruments made from stainless steel remain shiny bright because of deposition of chromium oxide layer on the surface of the metal which reduces the tendency to tarnish and corrosion.
Problem with stainless steel instruments is that they tend to lose their sharpness with repeated use, so they need to be sharpened again and again.

X ray was normal. The doctor ordered a bonescan. What is the likely diagnosis?","Shin splints (stress fracture) are seen in runners, army recruits or any vigorous physical activity. STRESS/FATIGUE FRACTUREStress fracture is due to imbalance between load and resistance of bone. It is of 2 types:1. Fatigue Fracture: caused by application of abnormal stress on normal bone.2. Insufficiency Fracture: caused by normal activity on weak bone. Sites of Stress FracturesLower Extremity* March fracture is a stress fatigue fracture of second metatarsal neck > 3rd metatarsal neck.* The most common site is metatarsal neck followed by tibia (proximal third in children, middle third in athlete and lower third in elderly).* Tibia stress fracture = Shin splints* Femoral neck (inferomedial compression side in young and superior tension side in older patients).* Rarely fibula lower end (runners fracture). Upper Extremity* Olecranon is most common site of upper limb stress fractures. Pelvis and SpinePars inter aicularis of 5th lumbar veebral (causing spondylolysis) is commonest in spine. Clinical Presentation* Load related pain often bilateral* The hallmark physical finding is tenderness with palpation and stress.

Which of the following zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts?,"The reaction of the periradicular tissues to noxious products of tissue necrosis, bacterial products and antigenic agents from the root canal has been described by Fish.
The four zones 

Zone of infection
Zone of contamination
Zone of irritation
Zone of stimulation


Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's. It contains cholesterol crystals.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.
In this zone, the eﬀects of toxins were mild enough to be stimulant which results in laying down of collagen ﬁbers around the zone of irritation that acts both as a wall of defense and as a scaﬀolding on which the osteoblasts built new bone.

"A pregnant lady with persistent late, variable deceleration with cervical dilatation of 6 cm shifted to OT for surgery. Which of the following is not done in Mmn:","“Deceleration is defined as a decrease in fetal heart rate below the base line of 15 beats per minute or more.”
Variable deceleration is seen in case of cord-compression/prolapse. In case of cord-compression/prolapse patient should not be allowed to rest in supine position as it will lead to more pressure on the cord. In cord prolapse the patient is allowed to rest in exaggerated elevated Sims position with a pillow under the hip.
Management of Non-reassuring fetal status (Fetal Distress)

Lateral positioning avoids compression of vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus. This increases cardiac output and uteroplacental perfusion.
Oxygen is administered to the mother with mask to improve fetal SaO2.
Correction of dehydration by IV fluids (crystalloids) improves intravascular volume and uterine perfusion.
Correction of maternal hypotension (following epidural analgesia) with immediate infusion of 1 litre of Crystalloid (Ringer’s solution).
Stoppage of oxytocin to improve fetal oxygenation. Fetal hypoxia may be due to strong and sustained uterine contractions. With reassuring FHR and in absence of fetal acidemia, oxytocin may be restarted.
Tocolytic (Injection terbutaline 0.25 mg S.C.) is given when uterus is hypertonic and there is nonreassuring FHR.
Amnioinfusion is the process to increase the intrauterine fluid volume with warm normal saline (500 ml). Indications are:

– Oligohydramnios and cord compression
– To dilute or to wash out meconium
– To improve variable or prolonged decelerations.

Prions true is:,"Prions are infectious particles, which can transmit disease.
These prions are composed of chiefly a protein without any detectable nucleic acid. This is a new name widely accepted for the old name slow viruses. The term prion was coined by Prusiner for proteinaceous infectious particles. 
Unlike conventional viruses, the prions apparently have no virion structure or genomes and evoke no immune response in the infected host. These are extremely resistant to inactivation by heat, disinfectants, and radiation.
The prions are causative agents of slow viral infections, such as subacute spongiform encephalopathy. After long incubation period of years, they produce a progressive disease that causes damage to the central nervous system, leading to subacute spongiform encephalopathy. 
They are readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC and resistant to antiseptics and disinfectants.

"A 10–month old baby previously normal, suddenly becomes distressed in his crib. The external appearance of genitalia was normal, except hyperpigmentation. lood glucose showed a level of 30 mg%. What is the most probable diagnosis ?","Familial glucocorticoid deficiency :

Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive condition.
It is characterized by adrenal insufficiency.
The pathological examination of the adrenal gland reveals that :-


Zona glomerulosa ---> well preserved.
Zona fasciculata ---> atrophied.
Zona reticularis  ---> atrophied.


This causes low cortisol concentration because the zona fasciculata is primarily responsible for glucocorticoid production.
Because the zona glomerulosa is well preserved mineralocorticoid action is usually unaffected.
Low circulating serum cortisol results in lack of feedback inhibition to the hypothalamus which results in increased ACTH secretion from pituitary.

Clinical features :

Patients with familial glucocorticoid deficiency generally presents with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency with the important distinction that mineralocorticoid production is always normal.
The most common initial presenting sign is deep hyperpigmentation of the skin, mucous membrane or both as a result of the action of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) on cutaneous melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) receptors.
The symptoms are compatible with glucocorticoid deficiency. Many patients presents with recurrent hypoglycemia or severe infections.
In the neonatal period, frequent presenting signs include - feeding problems, failure to thrive, regurgitation and hypoglycemia manifesting as seizures.",3,21 hydroxylase deficiency,Hyperinsulinism,Familial glucocorticoid deficiency,Cushing's syndrome,Pediatrics,,e448b7f6-af8c-4683-8b76-ec282a126797,multi,Familial glucocorticoid deficiency,Familial glucocorticoid deficiency,1.0000001192092896,0.7283543348312378,0.731795072555542,1.0000001192092896,0.6891341209411621,3

"4 year old boy presented with recurrent chest infections. Sweat chloride test was done, showed values of 36 and 42. What is the next best investigation to confirm the diagnosis ?","Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis 
1.   Sweat chloride testing

The sweat test is the standard approach to diagnosis.
The diagnosis is made by elevated sodium and chloride level in the sweat > 60 meq/1.
Two test on different days are required for accurate diagnosis.
A normal sweat chloride dose not exclude the diagnosis. Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis.

2.   Nasal potential difference

Measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
Individuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference.

3.   Genetic analysis

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder.
It is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein.
Cystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations.
More than 1500 CFTR polymorphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome.
The most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid A508.
This mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in northern European populations.
Approximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of northern European ancestry are homozygous for A508 and >70% carry at least one A508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has prevalance of more than several percent.
Testing for cystic fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease.
Now days commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations.
This testing identifies >90% individuals who carry 2CF mutations.
No where it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for A508 is enough for diagnosis.

Regarding ASO titre all are seen except –,"Evidence of antecedent group 'A' streptococcal infection 

Positive throat cultures or rapid streptococcal antigen tests for group A streptococcoci are less reliable for antecedent infection capable of producing rheumatic fever because they do not distinguish between recent infection and chronic pharyngeal carriage (as many people are carrier of this bacteria).
Antibody tests are the most reliable laboratory evidence of antecedent streptococcal infection capable of producing        g acute rheumatic fever. The onset of clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever coincides with the peak of the streptococcal antibody response.
The antibodies used commonly for serological tests are antistreptolysin 0 (ASO), antideoxyribonuclease (Anti-DNAse) and antihyaluronidase.
ASO titre is well standardized and therefore is most widely used test. It has following features.


Elevated in 80% of patients with acute rheumatic fever (So, 20% patients do not show elevated titre) Sensitivity is 80%.
It is elevated in 20% of normal individuals perticularly in healthy school children of elementary school age (20% false positive).
ASO titers of at least 333 Todd units in children and 250 Todd units in adults are considered elevated.
It is included in minor criteria of jones criteria (not in major criteria).


Anti DNAse B titers of 240 Todd units or greater in children and 1200 Todd units or greater in adults are considered elevated.
If three antibody tests (ASO, anti-DNAse and anti-hyaluronidase) are used simultaneously, a titer for at least one antibody test is elevated in 95% of cases —> Sensitivity of combined three antibody tests is 95%.
The streptozyme test is a simple slide agglutination test for extra-cellular streptococcal antigen absorbed to red blood cells (passive hemagglutination) test. It is almost 100% sensitive but specificity is very low and it is less standardized and less reproducible than the other antibody tests. Therefore, it should not be used as a diagnostic test for evidence of antecedent group A streptococcal infection.

All are true about aneuploidy except:,"Aneuploidy

Each human cell consists of 23 pair of chromosomes i.e., the normal chromosome number is 46
Aneuploidy is a deviation from the normal number of 46 chromosome. Which could be be 47 or 45 chromosomes or it can be defined as state of having chromosome number that is not multiple of 23.

Nondisjunction

Nondisjunction is failure of paired homologus chromosomes to separate during the first meiotic division that leads to the production of gametes (ova and spermatozoa).
Thus, some gametes receive two and other receive none of the involved pair. After the second meiotic division the resulting gametes will have 24 and 22 chromosomes respectively. Such gametes are aneuploid.

Anaphase lag

In anaphase lag, one homologus chromosome in meiosis or one chromatid in mitosis lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. This results in one normal cell and one cell with monosomy.

Survival of Aneuploidy

Monosomy or trisomy involving the sex chromosome are compatible with life and are usually associated with variable degree of phenotypic abnormalities.
Monosomy involving an autosome generally represents loss of too much genetic information to permit live births or  even embryogenesis.
With the exception of trisomy 21 all others will produce severely handicapped infants who almost invariably die at an early age.

Following renal disorder is associated with worst pregnancy outcome:,"Prognostic indicators in renal disease and pregnancy:

Most reliable prognostic indicator of the outcome of pregnancy is the presence of hypertension. The fetal prognosis for women with chronic renal disease is favorable as long as they do not develop superimposed preeclampsia.
Second to hypertension, the most valuable prognostic index for patients with chronic renal disease during pregnancy is the degree of renal function impairment:

– In patients with normal or only midly impaired renal function, pregnancy does not accelerate renal damage
– In patients with moderate renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL or greater before pregnancy or creatinine clearance <30 ml/min. there is a decline in renal function during pregnancy).

Another important prognostic sign is the presence or absence of proteinuria. As a general rule, if the patient has 2+ or more protein in qualitative tests or 3 g or more in 24 hours urine collections at the beginning of pregnancy, the tendency will be toward increased protein losses and development of nephritic syndrome during pregnancy.

The most common mechanism of ligament disruption of knee is abduction (valgus), flexion and internal rotation of femur on tibia which usually occur in sports in which the foot is planted solidly on the ground and leg is twisted by rotating body.
The medial structures medial (tibial) collateral ligament (MCL) and medial capsular ligament are first to fail, followed by ACL tear, if the force is of sufficient magnitude. The medial meniscus may be trapped between condyles and have a peripheral tear, thus producing unhappy triad of 0’ Donoghue.
Main test for MCL (medial collateral ligament) is valgus (abduction) stress in 30° of knee flexion. (Because in full extension it is indicative of combined MCL, posterior oblique ligament injury and posterior cruciate ligament injury).
Varus (Adduction) stress test in 30° flexion (removes the lateral stabilizing effect of iliotibial band so that the lateral collateral ligament can exclusively be examined).

A neonate develops encephalitis without any skin lesions. Most probable causative organisms is –,"Herpes simplex viruses


Herpes simplex is an important cause of encephalitis in the neonate, the infection acquired during delivery from the vaginal tract.
But it cause vesicular, ulcerative skin lesions
Even though it causes skin lesions, its our best option, as Nelson writes -
"" The hallmark of neonatal HSV infection- the vescicular ulcerative skin lesions are presnt in only 30 to 43% of children at presentation; one third will never manifest skin lesions.""
Out of the.two types of Herpes; Neonatal herpes is mainly caused by type II IISV (75 to 80%).

About other options
Meningpcocci

Its a rare cause of infection in neonates as neonates have antibodies (from mother) against meningiococcus which protects them for the initial 3 to 6 months of life.

Streptococci

Though streptococcus B is a common infection of neonates, it does not cause encephalitis.

Fever
Anemia
Thrombocytopenia
Normal total leukocyte count
Fragmented RBCs (Schistocytes) on peripheral smear.

Now let us review each option one by one
Option (a): DIC 
Harrison 20/e, p 979

DIC may present with sudden onset of fever (as the M/c cause of D/c is sepsis)
Excessive bleeding may lead to anemia
Platelet consumption may lead to thrombocytopenia
Leukocyte count is not affected
Intravascular microangiopathic hemolysis can lead to schistocytes on peripheral smear.

Williams Obs 23/e, p 786
Option (b): TTP i.e Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
TTP presents with a pentad of:

Fever
Microangiopathic haemolytic anemia, leading to anemia and fragmentation of RBCs
Thrombocytopenia
Neurologic symptoms
Renal failure.

Option (c): HELLP syndrome
HELLP syndrome presents with the combination of:

Hemolysis because of which fragmented RBC’s may be seen
Elevated liver enzymes and
Low platelet count
Fever may or may not be present.

Oprion (d): Evans syndrome
Hoffman: Hematology: Basic Principle and Practice, 5/e

Evans syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which an individual’s antibodies attack their own red blood cells and platelets.
Its overall pathology resembles a combination of autoimmune haemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
Autoimmune hemolysis leads to the formation of spherocytes and not schistocytes.
Schistocytes are fragmented RBCs that are the result of microangiopathic hemolysis.
Autoiminune destruction of RBCs leads to the formation of spherocytes.

Hence, Evans syndrome is the least likely possibility in this clinical scenario.",4,DIC,TTP,HELLP syndrome,Evans syndrome,Gynaecology & Obstetrics,,9468ca2d-bf9d-4819-8e72-15c5d9c6df2f,single,Evans syndrome,Evans syndrome,0.9999999403953552,0.5964514017105103,0.6473748683929443,0.8202732801437378,0.9999999403953552,4

A baby is born with meconium stained liquor which of the following is taken account of in terming a baby vigorous except –,"Resuscitation of neonate born through meconium-stained liquer (MSL) 

When baby passes meconium in utero, there is a chance that the mecomium will be aspirated into infant's mouth and potentially into the trachea and lungs.
Appropriate steps must be taken immediately after delivery to reduce the risk of serious consequences resulting from aspiration of meconium.
Intrapartum nasopharyngeal suctioning just after the delivery of head is no longer recommended as it does not reduce the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome and, on rare occasions, may cause nasophagngeal trauma or a cardiac arrhythmia.

The first step after delivery is to identify whether the newborn is vigrous or non-vigrous : -
A) Vigrous newborn

A newborn is classified as vigrous, if he has all the three signs are present : -


Strong respiratory effort
Good muscle tone
Heart rate greater than 100


The vigrous child does not require any tracheal suctioning and the usual initial steps of resuscitation are provided, i.e., provide warniith, positioning, suctioning of mouth and nose (not tracheal suctioning); Dry, stimulate and 02 if necessary.

B) Non-vigrous newborn

If any of the above three signs is present, the newborn is classified as non-vigrous.
For non-vigrous child, the initial steps are modified : -


Place the baby under radiant wanner and postpone suctioning to prevent stimulation of posterior pharyngeal wall that can cause bradycardia.
Residual meconium in the mouth and posterior pharynx should be removed by suctioning under direct vision using a laryngoscope.
The trachea should then be intubated and mechonium suctioned from the lower airway. Tracheal suctioning is best done by applying suction directly to the endotracheal tube.


After providing initial steps, the further management is same as with resucitation for other conditions.",2,Tone,Colour,HR,Respiration,Pediatrics,,5029ecd7-0f3f-495a-b662-b45589a2f9d7,multi,Colour,All of the above,0.6117348670959473,0.6358309388160706,0.611734926700592,0.64241623878479,0.6089053750038147,3

What is the cause of delirium tremens in alcoholics?,"Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome and Delirium Tremens Alcohol withdrawal syndrome typically occurs within 1-2 days of alcohol abstinence and is characterized by autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, transient hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and tonic-clonic seizures. Symptoms may be mild for many patients, but if left untreated, it can lead to delirium tremens, an uncommon but severe and life-threatening manifestation of withdrawal marked by severe hallucinations, disorientation, and autonomic overactivity. Symptoms and signs include the following: Profoundly delirious state associated with tremulousness and agitation. Excessive motor activity (most notable as a tremor that affects the face, tongue, and extremities but that may also involve speech) and purposeless activity such as picking at the bedclothes. Hallucinations, classically visual rather than auditory, are a prominent feature. Autonomic nervous system hyperactivity: tachycardia, dilated pupils, fever, and hyperhidrosis. Loss of orientation as to time and place. Such patients are often oblivious to the most obvious features of the surrounding environment. Treatment Note temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and record results twice hourly to monitor for hyperpyrexia and hypotension. Consider lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis if fever or meningismus is present. 1. FLUIDS Fluid requirements on the first day of treatment may be as if profound dehydration is present. Intravenous fluid should contain glucose to prevent hypoglycemia. 2. THIAMINE Thiamine, 100 mg/d, prevents Wernicke encephalopathy. 3. BENZODIAZEPINES Benzodiazepines are the primary form of treatment. They may also prevent patients with impending delirium tremens from developing a full-blown case.Drug of choice-Chlordiazepoxide a - Fatty liver- irrelevant b - Its abrupt withdrawal not gradual d - Small doses of alcohol consumption will not lead to raving.

Which of the following material is not applied for root conditioning after placement of MTA?,"Based on periodontal research, it would appear that if a root surface conditioning agent were to be used during periradicular surgery, EDTA might be the most appropriate solution. However, the manufacturer (personnel communication, Dr.  Torabinejad)  has  advised  against  the  use  of  EDTA  when mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is used as a root-end filling material,  because  it  may  interfere  with  the  hard  tissue–producing effect of MTA.

HbA2 is raised in:,"Failure to synthesise beta chains (beta-thalassaemia) is the most common type of thalassaemia, most prevalent in the Mediterranean area. Heterozygotes have thalassaemia minor, a condition in which there is usually mild microcytic anaemia and little or no clinical disability, which may be detected only when iron therapy for a mild microcytic anaemia fails. Homozygotes (thalassemia major) either are unable to synthesise haemoglobin A or, at best, produce very little; after the ﬁrst 4–6 months of life, they develop profound transfusion-dependent hypochromic anaemia.
Key Concept: 
In beta thalassemia, HbA2 quantity is raised.

Which of the following cephalometric analysis does not reveal the severity of anteroposterior jaw dysplasia?,"Down's analysis provides information by which we can determine whether the individual’s pattern shows comparatively harmonious relations or not and whether dysplasia present in a person is in the facial skeleton, the dentition or in both.
Steiner concluded that it might not be possible to correct dentition according to ideal norms in non-growing patients whose skeletal relations cannot be altered. The imperative here is to come up with an acceptable compromise for the dentition, one that will mask the underlying skeletal deformity as much as possible. This can be achieved using Steiner’s sticks, which allow calculations to be carried out for a particular ANB value.
In addition to commonly used sagittal discrepancy indicators, that is angle ANB, sagittal maxilla mandibular relationship should be reconfirmed with other variables which include WITS appraisal, A–B plane angle and beta angle. 
Key Concept:
Tweed’s analysis (originally undertaken in 1954) is primarily based on inclination of the mandibular incisors to the basal bone and the latter’s association with the vertical relation of the mandible to the cranium. Tweed’s analysis is clinically oriented. It does not directly assess the jaws.

Direction of force by class III elastic in face mask?,"Biomechanical Considerations
The maxilla can be advanced 2-4 mm forward over a period of 8-12 months. The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:

Amount of force: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.
Direction of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.
	In most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.
	However, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.
Duration of force: A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.
Frequency of use: 12-14 hrs/day.

Key Concept:
According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.

All are done in management of shoulder dystocia except:,"Shoulder Dystocia:
The term shoulder dystocia is used to define a wide range of difficulties encountered in the delivery of the shoulders (A head to body delivery time exceeding 60 secs defines shoulder dystocia).
Risk factors: Shoulder dystocia can occur in all those conditions where fetus is too big or in case of mismanaged labour.
D-Maternal diabetes
O-Maternal obesity and fetal obesity, i.e macrosomia
P-Post-term pregnancy
A-Anencephaly, Fetal ascites
Management of shoulder dystocia:
Shoulder dystocia should be managed as quickly as possible as interval of time from delivery of head to delivery of body is of great importance as far as survival of baby is concerned. Management follows a sequence of steps together called as Shoulder Dystocia Drill.
First line measures:

Immediately after recognition of shoulder dystocia extra help should be called, in the form of midwifery assistance, an obstetrician, a paediatric resuscitation team and an anaesthetist.
Maternal pushing should be discouraged, as this may lead to further impaction of the shoulder, thereby exacerbating the situation.
Liberal episiotomy should be given to provide more space posteriorly.
Fundal pressure should not be employed. As it is associated with an unacceptably high neonatal complication rate and may result in uterine rupture.
Moderate suprapubic pressure can be applied by the assistant.
McRoberts’ manoeuvre is the single most effective intervention and should the first maneouvre to be performed. The
McRobert’s manoeuvre is flexion and abduction of the maternal hips, positioning the maternal thighs on her abdomen.

Second line measures: They should be done only, if first line measures fail:

Wood’s manoeuvre: It is progressively rotating the posterior shoulder by 180°. So that the impacted anterior shoulder is released.

Third line measures—They should be done only, if second line measures fail:
