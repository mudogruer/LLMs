A mother is Hbs Ag positive and anti Hbe Ag positive. Risk of transmission of Hep. B in child is:,"Before answering these questions lets first discuss hepatitis in brief.
Maternal infection: The acute infection is manifested by flu like illness as malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon.
Clinical course (HBV): Nearly 90–95% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Diagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107–1011).
Screening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for ‘high risk’ groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).
Hepatitis C (HCV):
It is recognized as the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide and is the leading cause of transfusion associated hepatitis. Transmission is mainly blood borne and to a lesser extent by faecal-oral route. It is responsible for chronic active hepatitis and hepatic failure.
Perinatal transmission (10–40%) is high when coinfected with HIV and HBV.
Detection is by antibody to HCV by EIA, which develops usually late in the infection.
Confirmation is done by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-3).
Chronic carrier state is present. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.
Hepatitis D (HDV):
It is seen in patients infected with HBV either as a co-infection or super infection. Perinatal transmission is known.
Hepatitis E (HEV): Hepatitis E is the most important cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis in developing countries like India. Chronic carrier state is present. Perinatal transmission is uncommon.

Key Points 
HBsAg:

The antigen appears in blood during incubation period and is detectable in most patients during the prodrome and acute phase of the disease.
Persistent presence of HBsAg in blood for at least 6 months indicates the carrier state and also indicates the risk of chronic hepatitis and hepatic carcinoma. It is not detectable in the serum during convalescent stage. The presence of HBsAg alone does not necessarily indicate the replication of complete virion, and the patients may not have symptoms of liver damage.

"A patient went into shock immediately after normal delivery, likely cause:","Friends this is one of those questions where we can derive the answer by excluding other options as very little information has been provided to us.
Sudden post partum collapse – may be seen in all the four cases viz – amniotic fluid embolism, PPH, uterine inversion and eclampsia.
But in case of PPH antecedent H/O excessive blood loss, in eclampsia – H/O antecedent convulsions and in amniotic fluid embolism – H/O abrupt onset of respiratory distress before collapse should be present, which is not given in the question so these options are being excluded.
The clinical picture of acute inversion occurring in the third stage of labour is characterised by shock and haemorrhage, the shock being out of proportion to the bleeding.

"Which of the following type of failure may occur, if the coefficient of thermal expansion of ceramic is much lower than that of metal?","A thermal contraction mismatch that results from a higher coeﬃcient of contraction of porcelain (αP is greater than αM) will introduce residual tangential and hoop tensile stresses. The additive eﬀect of tangential tensile stress induced in the porcelain by the intraoral force can exceed the tensile strength of the porcelain and causes crack propagation in the porcelain veneer. When the contraction coeﬃcient of the porcelain is much lower than that of the metal (αP much lower than αM), porcelain cracking or metal-ceramic bond failure can occur near the metal-porcelain interface. This incompatibility failure is likely caused by the development of radial tensile stresses that exceed the tensile strength of porcelain.

Sugar restricted to diet was beneficial in presence of unfavorable hygiene was from which study?,"HOPEWOOD HOUSE STUDY 
(Sullivan and Harris- 1958, Harris- 1963 ) 
The dental status Of children between 7 to 14 years of age residing at Hopewood House, Bowral New South Wales, was studied longitudinally for 10 years. Almost all these children had lived from early infancy at Hopewood House. 
All lived on a strictly natural diet, that, with the exception of on occasional serving of egg yolk, was entirely vegetable in nature and largely raw. The absence of meat and restriction of refined carbohydrate were the principal features of the Hopewood House diet. 
The meals were supplemented by vitamin concentrates and an occasional serving of nuts and a sweetening agent such as honey. The fluoride content of water and food was insignificant and no tea was consumed. 
TURKU SUGAR STUDY 
(Scheinin and Makinen in 975) 
The study was carried outin Turku, Finland. 
Aim Of the study 
To compare the cariogenicity of sucrose, fructose and Xylitol. 
Basis of the study 
XylitoI is a sweet substance not metabolized by plaque micro organisms.
Key Concept:
In Hopewood house study : the children's oral hygiene was poor, calculus is uncommon,  but  gingivitis  was  prevalent  in 75%  of  children. This work  showed  that,  in institutionalized  children  at  least,  dental caries  can  be  reduced  by  a  spartan  diet, without the beneficial effects of fluoride  and in the presence of unfavorable oral hygiene.

"In alpha-thalassemia trait,electrophoresis shows:March 2005","Ans. B: Normal HbF and normal HbA2Alpha (0) thalassemia -Individuals with this disorder are not able to produce any functional alpha-globin and thus are unable to make any functional hemoglobin A, F, or A2. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis, also known as hemoglobin Ba, a condition that is incompatible with extra uterine life.Alpha (+) thalassemia - genetic mutations that result in decreased production of alpha-globin usually due to the functional deletion of 1 of the 4 alpha globin genes. Based on the number of inherited alpha genes, it is subclassified into 3 general forms:Thalassemia (-u/ a a) is characterized by inheritance of 3 normal a-genes. These patients are referred to clinically as silent carrier of alpha thalassemia. Other names for this condition are alpha thalassemia minima, alpha thalassemia-2 trait, and heterozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia minor. The affected individuals exhibit no abnormality clinically and may be hematologically normal or have mild reductions in red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of 2 normal alpha genes due to either heterozygosity for alpha (0) thalassemia (u a/ --) or homozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia (-u/-a) results in the development of alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia-1 trait. The affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia and reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of one normal alpha gene (-a/ --) results in abundant formation of hemoglobin H. This condition is known as ElbH disease.

Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.
In this zone, the eﬀects of toxins were mild enough to be stimulant which results in laying down of collagen ﬁbers around the zone of irritation that acts both as a wall of defense and as a scaﬀolding on which the osteoblasts built new bone.

In remaining patients,the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most of these patients have loss of function mutation involving either CD40 or enzyme called AID. So, B-cells can be detected by flowcytometryhaving low expression of CD40. Bruton's disease -In this disease, there is defect in B-cell tyrosine kinase enzyme. This leads to hypogammaglobulinemia. Bare lymphocyte syndrome- In this disorder, There is defect in MHC-2 molecule which is required for CD4 T-cell formation.

AR polycystic kidney is ruled out because the age of presentation in ARPKD is childhood and most of the affected children do not survive beyond their childhood.
AD polycystic kidney is ruled out because there is no association of ADPKD with lenticonus as is mentioned in our question.

–– Alport syndrome is manifest by hematuria with progression to chronic renal failure, accompanied by nerve deafness and various eye disorders, including lens dislocation, posterior cataracts, and corneal dystrophy.
–– In about 85% cases, it is inherited as an X-linked trait. So, males express the full syndrome, and females are carriers in whom manifestations of disease are typically limited to hematuria.
–– Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms also exist in which both the sexes are equally susceptible.
–– In Alport syndrome, Hematuria is the earliest manifestation and the sensorineural deafness is the commonest extra renal abnormality.",4,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease,Oxalosis,Alport syndrome,Pathology,,dabfee93-2e1b-4e6c-bff6-03c025bd986f,single,Alport syndrome,Alport syndrome,Alport syndrome

"A screening test is used in same way in two similar populations, but the proportion of false positive results among those who test positive in population A is lower than among those who test positive in population B. What is the likely explanation for this finding?","Total population having the disease : ‘a + c’ (TP + FN)
Total population not having the disease : ‘b + d’ (FP + TN)
Total population: a + b + c + d = TP + FP + FN + TN

PPV depends on sensitivity, specificity and prevalence of disease in the population.
Now in this question, a screening test is used in same way in two similar populations; thereby the screening test will have similar sensitivity and specificity in both populations.
PPV = a/ (a + (b) X 100, thus b (False Positive rate) is inversely proportional to PPV; and PPV is directly proportional to Prevalence of disease in a population.
So, False Positive rate (FP rate) is inversely proportional to the prevalence of disease in the population.
Therefore, if the same screening test is having lower FP rate in population A (as compared to a similar population B), then this could be explained by higher prevalence of disease in population A
Also,",1,The prevalence of disease is higher in population A,The prevalence of disease is lower in population A,The specificity of the test is lower in population A,The specificity of the test is higher in population A,Social & Preventive Medicine,,d8b70d4b-8a90-4739-b18a-33c1d42b9708,multi,The prevalence of disease is higher in population A,Higher prevalence of disease in population A,Higher prevalence of the condition in population A.

Strain is defined as:,"Strain—Change in dimension per unit initial dimension. For tensile and compressive strain, a change in length is measured relative to the initial reference length.
Strain, or the change in length per unit length, is the relative deformation of an object subjected to a stress. Strain may be either elastic, plastic, elastic and plastic, or viscoelastic. Elastic strain is reversible. The object fully recovers its original shape when the force is removed.

Which cement is irritating to the pulp?,"The phosphoric acid in the liquid makes the mixture quite acidic and therefore cytotoxic, when a prosthesis is luted with this cement on a prepared tooth. As setting occurs, the acidity is partially neutralized, but the cement remains acidic after 24 hours, with the pH rising from about 3 to about 6. For thin layers of dentin, a cavity liner (i.e.,Ca2) is recommended to prevent an adverse pulpal response from the pressure of luting, which forces acid into the pulp tissue. Younger patients are especially susceptible, because they have a more open dentin tubule area, whereas older patients with sclerotic dentin will have a more tortuous path that restricts the penetration of acid toward the pulp.
Key concept​​ :
pH of the cement
The acidity is high at the time of insertion due to phosphoric acid. At the time of cementation, the pH is 2 (approx.). As time passes, the acidity reduces. By the end of 24 hours, the pH is 5.5, which is still in the acidic range (neutral value is 7).

A child is admitted on 7 days of life with severe respiratory distress and shock. He was discharged 2 days back healthy. What could be the probable diagnosis –,"livpolastic left heart syndrome 

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).
Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.
The problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:

(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body
Entrace and exit of the ventricle
Mitral and aortic valves

This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.
In patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.
The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic

arteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two
of these connections:
(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)
Ductus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)

Both of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.
In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.
Babies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.
Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).

Symptoms

At first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:


Bluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color
Cold hands and feed (extremities)


Lethargy


Poor pulse
Poor suckling and feeding
Pounding heart
Rapid breathing
Shortness of breath.
Since the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.
Signs of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.

Ventricular septal defect

These patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.
They usually present with congestive cardiac failure.

Ebstein's anomaly 

Ebstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.
These patients usually present in teenage/adolescent years.
They may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.

An Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.

An I.V. drug abuser presents with fever for 10 days. CXR shows B/L lower lobe consolidation with necrosis and right sided pyopneumothorax. Probable diagnosis is:,"Infective endocarditis typically occurs at sites of pre-existing endocardial damage, but infection with particularly virulent or aggressive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus can cause endocarditis in a previously normal heart. Staphylococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve is a common complication of intravenous drug use. Many acquired and congenital cardiac lesions are vulnerable, particularly areas of endocardial damage caused by a high-pressure jet of blood, such as ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, many of which are haemodynamically insigniﬁcant. In contrast, the risk of endocarditis at the site of haemodynamically important low-pressure lesions, such as a large atrial septal defect, is minimal.

In liver, these fatty acids are broken down by beta-oxidation of fatty acids to give Acetyl CoA. This excess acetyl CoA obtained from fatty acids breakdown is used for the formation of fats e.g. fatty acids, endogenous TGs, VLDL & cholesterol. This is the only anabolic thing occurring in the liver of diabetic patients. Options A & B - wrong as the body is mainly in catabolism, not anabolism.

Apgars 4 and 5 at 1 and 5 minutes. History of one month female sibling died before. What is the diagnosis ?","""Respiratory distress in an infant along with a positive family history of similarly affected newborn infants strongly suggests, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis"".
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disorder characterized by the intraalveolar accumulation of pulmonary surfactant.
Two clinically distinct forms of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis are seen -


Fatal form                                -->          Presenting shortly after birth (congenital PAP)

u Gradually progressive form -->           Presenting in older infants and children
Pathology

Although the mechanisms that lead to alveolar proteinosis are undefined, histological findings suggests that they result in a disruption of pulmonary surfactant metabolism.
The main surface tension lowering agent in surfactant is phospholipids le. primary dipalmitol phosphatidyl choline.
However DPCC needs surfactant protein (in endogenous and natural surfactants) for efficient dispersion which enables the formation of a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.
There are two surfactant proteins present in the body i.e., protein A and protein B.
In pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, there is absence of protein B.
In the absence of protein B, the rapid spread and absorption of the phospholipid (DPCC) does not take place so they cannot form a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.
This in turn leads to failure of expansion of alveoli leading to poor cardiorespiratory adaptation at birth.

Clinical manifestation -

This disorder is immediately apparent in the newborn period and rapidly leads to respiratory failure.
Congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from more common disorders of the newborn that lead to respiratory failure including pneumonia, generalized bacterial infection, respiratory distress syndrome and total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction.

Diagnosis

Histopathological examination of lung biopsy specimen is the gold standard for diagnosis.
On histopathological examination distal air spaces are filled with a granular, eosinophillic material that stains

positively with periodic - acid schiff reagent and is diastase resistant.
Treatment

Untreated, alveolar proteinosis in newborns is rapidly fatal and no successful medical therapy has been developed.
Repeated bronchoalveolar lavage is a temporizing measure.
Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option but its use is limited by concerns about disease recurrence.",3,TAPVC,Meconium aspiration,Neonatal pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,Diffuse herpes simplex infection,Pediatrics,,f1cbc766-a7ea-44ec-ba8b-997ffc3a028a,single,Neonatal pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis,Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN)

Hardness of stone surface is affected by?,"Colloidal systems such as agar and alginate retard the setting of gypsum products. If these materials are in contact with CaSO4·½H2O during setting, a soft, easily abraded surface is obtained. Accelerators such as potassium sulfate are added to improve the surface quality of the set CaSO4·2H2O against agar or alginate.
These colloids do not retard the setting by altering the solubility ratio of the hemihydrate and dihydrate forms, but rather by being adsorbed on the hemihydrate and dihydrate nucleation sites, thus interfering in the hydration reaction. The adsorption of these materials on the nucleating sites retards the setting reaction more effectively than adsorption on the calcium sulfate hemihydrate.

"The principal reason for placing an aluminium filter in
the primary beam of radiation is to:","Although an x-ray beam consists of a continuous spectrum of x-ray photon energies, only photons with sufficient energy to penetrate through anatomic structures and reach the image receptor (digital or film) are useful for diagnostic radiology. Low-energy photons that cannot reach the receptor contribute to patient risk but do no offer any benefit. Consequently, it is desirable to remove these low-energy photons from the beam. This removal can be accomplished in part by placing a metallic disk (filter) in the beam path. 
A filter preferentially removes low-energy photons from the beam, while allowing high energy photons that are able to contribute to making an image to pass through.

Macrocephaly is seen in which of the following syndromes ?,"LEUCO J ITS TROPHY

Leucodystrophy refers to progressive degeneration of the white matter of the brain clue to imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibre.
Myelin which lends its color to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of at least ten different chemicals.
The leucodystrophy are a group of disorders that are caused by genetic defects in hoW myelin produces or metabolizes these chemicals.
Each of the leucodystrophies in the result of a defect in the gene that controls one (and only one) of the chemicals. Specific leusodystrophies include -
Metachroinatic leucodystrophy          ❑ Adrenoleucodystrophy                                 

​❑ Canavan disease

Krabbe's disease                                                 ❑ Pelizaeus-Merzhacher disease                                                         ​ ❑ Alexander disease


Symptoms vary according to the specific type of leucodystrophy and may be difficult to recognize in the early stages of the disease.

Canavan's disease 

Autosomal recessive disorder
Caused due to deficiency of the enzyme N-Aspertoacylase.
This leads to accumulation of N-Acetyl aspartic acid in brain and urine.
It is characterized by the clinical traid of --> Hypotonia, Head lag, Macrocephaly 

​​Adrenoleucodvstrophy

X-linked recessive disorder
Caused due to deficiency of AcyI-C'oA synthetase.
Onset is about 5-10 years
Main symptoms are ataxia, spasticity, motor deficits, cortical blindness.
Marocephaly is not a key feature 
Metachromatic leucodystrophy 
Autosomal recessive disorder
Caused due to Arylsulfatase A deficiency
Onset is in the 2nd year.
Symptoms are into-ordination, especially gait disturbance, then general regression, optic atrophy, combined upper and lower motor neuron signs.
Marocephaly usually late.

The major effect of coicosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription. Coicosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of IQ-receptors.

NESTROFT test is a screening test for –,"NESTROFT ( Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test) is a screening test for detection of beta thalassemia trait.

Thalassemia screening

Widespead prevlence of thalessemia has led to a pressing demand for community, screening.
Various methods for screening of thalassemia trait are available which include peripheral smear examination, RBC indices, 1VIeintzer's fraction, discriminant functions, NESTROFT etc.
NESTROFT TEST is used in many centres in India for screening of thalassemia trait.
If mother is NESTROFT positive, the confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for mother and the father is subjected to screening by NESTROFT. If father is also NESTROFT positive, confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for father.
If both the parents have thalessemia trait, there is 1:4 chance of fetus having thalassemia major.
Therefore, prenatal diagnosis is done by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in first trimester.
If CVS confirms the fetus to be having thalasemia major, termination of pregnancy is indicated after counseling the parents.
If the fetus has thalassemia minor (trait) pregnancy is continued as such and baby will have normal lifespan.
It is worth noting here that a positive NESTROFT test is seen in other conditions beside beta thalassemia trait. These are iron deficiency anemia, alpha thalassemia trait, homozygous and heterozygous HbE, HbS as well as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.

Therefore, a positive NESTROFT test should always be followed by a confirmatory test for HBA2 ( eg. serum electrophoresis).",1,β–thalassemia,Hereditary spherocytosis,Autoimmune hemolytic anemia,Megaloblastic anemia,Pediatrics,,0c4f5b5b-25ec-459f-9872-a01bc925f211,single,β–thalassemia,Beta thalassemia trait,Thalassemia

"The single most effective method of reducing patient
somatic exposure when taking radiograph is to use:","Intraoral dental X-ray film is available in two speed groups: D and E/F.
Clinically, film of speed group E/F is approximately twice as fast (sensitive) as film of group D and thus requires only half the exposure. Fast films are desirable from the standpoint of exposure reduction. Multiple studies have found that E/F-speed film is preferred, because it has the same useful density range, latitude, contrast, and image quality as D-speed films and can be used in routine intraoral radiographic examinations without sacrifice of diagnostic information. 
Current digital sensors offer equal or greater dose savings than E/F-speed film and comparable diagnostic utility.

A boy is suffering from acute pyelonephritis. The most specific investigation is,"The answer is A Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection causing inflammation of the kidneys and is one of the most common diseases of the kidney.Pyelonephritis occurs as a complication of an ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) which spreads from the bladder to the kidneys and their collecting systems.Symptoms usually include fever, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, burning on urination, increased frequency, and urgency. The 2 most common symptoms are usually fever and flank pain. E. coli is the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis due to its unique ability to adhere to and colonize the urinary tract and kidneys.Histopathology will usually reveal necrosis or putrid abscess formation within the renal parenchyma. The renal tissues are infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages and plasma cells. However, architecture is not completely disorganized.The presence of white blood cells within or upon casts strongly suggests pyelonephritis, direct infection of the kidney.

"All are true about rheumatic fever, except –","Rheumatic fever

Rheumatic fever is an acute immunologically mediated multisystem inflammatory disease that occurs few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.
The disease is immune mediated, not a communicable disease.
	Epidemiology ofAcute Rheumatic fever.
The epidemiology of acute Rheumatic fever is identical to that of group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection.
As is the case of streptococcal sore throat, acute rheumatic fever most often occurs in children, the peak age related incidence is between 5-15 years.
Epidemiological risk factor for rheumatic fever, include lower standards of living especially crowding, the disease has been more common among socially and economically disadvantaged populations.

Pathogenesis of Rheumatic fever

It is strongly suspected that acute Rheumatic fever is a hypersensitivity reaction induced by group A streptococci but the exact pathogenesis remains uncertain despite many years of investigation.
Although the precise factor or factors that confer this property are unknown, highly rheumatogenic strains, share certain biological characteristic.
It is believed that antibodies directed against the M proteins of certain strains cross reacts with glycoprotein antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues. These strains are (1, 3, 5, 6, 18).
The M proteins molecules has a particular surface exposed antigenic domain against which Rheumatic fever patients mount a strong antibody response. These antibodies against the M proteins cross reacts with glycoproteins antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues because these glycoproteins share similar features with M antigenic domain.",3,Common in poor socioeconomic group,Develops after streptococcal pharyngitis,Communicable disease,Seen in 5–15 years of children,Pediatrics,,41fac382-483b-4573-99c4-555b80dff3bc,multi,Communicable disease,It is a communicable disease,It is caused by direct infection of the heart by group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.

Bonding agents have hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups. The hydrophobic group binds which structure?,"Ideally, a dentin bonding agent should have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic ends. The hydrophilic end displaces the dentinal fluid to wet the surface. The hydrophobic end bonds to the composite resin.
Bonding: The forces or energies between atoms or molecules at an interface that hold two phases together.
Mechanism of bonding:
Dentin adhesive molecule has a bifunctional structure:
M-R-X
Where,
M is the double bond of methacrylate which copolymerizes with composite resin.
R is the spacer which makes the molecule large.
X is a functional group for bonding, which bonds to an inorganic or organic portion of dentin.
